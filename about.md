Hi! I'm Si.

I am a highly experienced and successful strategist, product/service/experience/interaction designer, maker of things, and organiser of gigs. My work is usually digitally enabled and always people focused.

I believe in research, knowing, teamwork and collaboration, playing to our strengths, and doing by making. Design is the process.

Sometimes I work against a brief. Other times from nothing and we learn where we go through discovery. And sometimes I [just hack stuff together](/side-projects), just for the hell of it (and to give my rusty coding skills a run out).

I started off as a junior web developer in 1998 as job to pay the bills after learning HTML in my evenings at university. I've worked "across and up" to do strategy and design work, becoming a digital lead, creative manager, digital creative and development director, and chief operations officer, in some of Leeds's biggest and smartest creative and digital businesses.

Along the way I've helped organisations such as ADT, Defra, DWP, [HMRC](/tag/hmrc-digital/), Leeds City Council, Linkdex, Jet2.com, [the NHS](/tag/nhs/), and Persimmon Homes.

I currently work as an accidental freelancer as a lead interaction designer at HMRC.

I try to write regularly about work here. If you want something a bit more static about my previous work there's a PDF portfolio I hustled together for a prospect [over here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpoy4q7r7qtaxwh/simon%20wilson%20-%20ux%20portfolio%20creds.pdf?dl=0).

You can usually see where and when on [my availability page](/availability) and [LinkedIn page](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/siwilson/).

I also run events, helping organise Leeds Digital Festival and the Leeds Digital Conference a few years back, used to organise the Leeds Digital Lunches, might do another [Get into Gaming](getintogaming.co.uk) with Sean if our calendars ever align, and am involved with [GovJam in Leeds](https://leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/). Sometimes I stand up front, doing speaking engagements, having popped up at [NUX](/tag/NUX/) and [Forefront](/tag/forefront-leeds/), as well as being invited into places to do "behind closed doors" talks.

I volunteer to help out at the [Bradford CoderDojo](http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo), aimed at engaging and enabling young people with design through digital and technology.

I live in [Idle, Bradford, West Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Idle,+Bradford,+West+Yorkshire+BD10/@53.8372139,-1.8040416,12z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x487be38e02277d49:0xd28ce4d95e48f3e7?hl=en), but travel a lot, around and out of the UK.

I am also a dad, husband, dog walker/cushion, reader, watcher of films/lover of cinema, gardener, ex-school governor, cleaner, converted coffee enthusiast, cake consumer, occasional cook, and supporter of Grimsby Town Football Club (once upon a time I even helped set up, run, and contribute to the awesome mind- and award-winning [Cod Almighty](http://www.codalmighty.com/)).

If you want to talk, feel free! You can [get my contact details here](/contact). Don't be a stranger now.
