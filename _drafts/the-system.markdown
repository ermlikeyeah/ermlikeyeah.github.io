How’s homeschooling been going four you?

Things heated up at my end a a few weeks back when the amount of the boy’s school work increased. We got access to an email address we could access online through Outlook, we got access to Teams, then a Trello board, and then other things. We were learning the what and how as we went along, each subject getting in touch separately with their process. I started to map it all lightly, the process for each, where the work is set and done, how to talk to teachers, how to “submit” etc.

\[map\]

Getting the work and knowing where to look was one thing.

If the boy was at school he would have been in a lesson in a classroom, noted down the details of any work in his journal and planned from that. It wasn’t perfect. We always had to check he wasn’t leaving it all to the last minute. Where was that sheet he needed to do the work? But there was a system.

That process has moved from a passive collection to a gathering and analysis approach.

To help with this at the start of the week we have a sticky for every subject the boy studies. We look through the systems the lessons use and see what is needed. This means a look at — and that means a look over — the work set. We write onto the stickie

1. The subject.
2. A brief description of the work. Not “work on Trello” but a brisk overview of the work, like “questions about rap”.
3. Any deadline (sometimes there is a time on a day not just a day).

Looking over the work gives us a rough idea of the size of the work. We then put the stickies onto a sheet of A3, with a row for each day of the week. We try to have about three subjects for each day. What subjects go where?

Another contributory factor: There are some lessons the boy likes more than others, and there are some lessons he likes less. This gives us a better chance of spreading the likes and the less-likes.
