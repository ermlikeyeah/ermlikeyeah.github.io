Here's a thing you need to know up front: I am a big fan of NBA basketball.

At the moment the NBA season is in the final straight - there's two final series going on, one each from the East conference and the West conference. Two teams play each other in each series: Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets in the west, and Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers in the west.

I live in the UK, so these games are usually played at some point past midnight.
