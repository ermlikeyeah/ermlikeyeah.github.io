[Previously I left off](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-2) feeling disappointed and uncertain having not been told the outcome of my test reults.

Yesterday I remembered I could access my test results using SystmOnline, the system my GP practice uses.

I accessed the system and found my test results had been returned.
