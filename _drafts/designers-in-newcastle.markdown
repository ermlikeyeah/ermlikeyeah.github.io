Hello. 

I am looking for freelance interaction designers and content designers to come work with the gang at HMRC in Newcastle for the next couple of months. You'll be helping with our digital transformation work. I've [blogged a bit about that](/tag/hmrc-digital/).

We're user focused team, so you'll have a user-centred portfolio of work that shows your understanding and reasoning to make things that work, that are effective, not just pretty things. We're agile and so will you be. Because of that we'll need you on-site, so remote working isn't an option. And you'll be good.

Being able to do front-end coding would be beneficial given the way we prototype in-browser.

And you don't have to work with me, so don't sweat about that. We're just after good people to come and help us out.

If you're interested and want to talk further get me on [simon.wilson@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:simon.wilson@digital.hmrc.gov.uk), my work email address. Please do not contact me through my personal email address.

No recruiters or agencies, thanks.
