In [my run note for last month](/run-note-for-july-2020/) I briefly mentioned I had retired a pair of running shoes. 

I feel if we’re trying to encourage people to be active (and I have been one of those people over the last few years, but been perfect willing to) we should also understand and enable a responsible lifecycle for the things in those activities. Encouraging more people to be active should mean more things. Nothing lasts forever which should mean more waste. If we just drop them in the trash that's already a lot, possible a lot more running shoes that [take many years to degrade](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/21/some-soles-last-1000-years-in-landfill-the-truth-about-the-sneaker-mountain). No running shoes I’ve bought comes with an “end of life” suggestion.

Finding things that are made from recycled materials, easier. That’s the start of my engagement with the product. But when I’m done? Have read about Nike in the US taking finished running shoes to make sports pitches but so so few schemes, manufacturers or elsewhere.

The running shoes have been by the front door for a good week now. I’ve another pair with them now, so that's two pairs of running shoes "done". Done? Their soles have gone, for running purposes anyway.

I want them to be recycled.

My options:

1\. Is it OK to send them to a charity shop with a note “Not OK for running anymore, should could be OK for casual”? What would a charity shop do? Put them out with that note? I cannot imagine that. Put them out without the note? I'd worry someone might buy them for running and the soles cause them issues. Or the charity does some analysis and gets rid of them. Straight to the trash? Misses the point. They look to get them recycled? That's just me passing on my problem.

2\. Find a dedicated running shoes recycling service. Is there one?
