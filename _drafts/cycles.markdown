I am not doing much running at the moment. I am “recovering” from a stress fracture on my right tibia, which my doctor believes is just from doing a lot of running.

My doctor and physio want me to get back to running. They want me, my body to do work that 1. isn’t running and 2. running. .But they also want me to rest, while I recover and also when I get back to running.

As part of my recovery I work closely with a physio. We have a programme that I am following. Less guidelines, more rules. I need to stick to these. It’s very deliberate, very gradual, very measured.

Rule number 1: There is a programme.

Rule number 2: Stick to the programme, do nothing more than planned, don’t push it.

Rule number 3: If I feel any pain in the bones stop, take a break.

The programme have three day cycles:

Day 1: Some stretches, pushes, jumping. A long walk or a bike session.

Day 2: A run*.

Day 3: Rest, in that do nothing or a walk.

Then I go back to day 1. Day 1 I might do the same as I did in the previous cycle or a little more (as agreed with my physio) — but nothing but a little more. Day 2 the same. Day 3 I must adhere to rest, to let my body recover, to rebuild.

I have regular catch ups with my physio, over the phone. I keep a light record of how it is going and because I track my activity — runs on Strava, exercise on paper —  we keep it deliberate, gradual and measured.

I learned a lot years ago about how muscles recover and rebuild. The last six months I have learned a lot about how bones recover and rebuild.

Last summer I was wondering about how we “recover”, how we feel we must always be doing something rather than resting to recover. Recover as a verb versus recover as a noun. My doctor believes I need to have more rest time, let my body rebuild. Over time I could be back to running every two days, but I need to make sure my right tibia is strong before I do that.

The more interesting part of the planning has been the cycles I am following. At the start of the planning my mind was automatically tuned to a seven day cycle, a weekly cycle. My physio said a three day cycle repeated would be best, help me get into and have a rhythm, help my body work and rest. If we did a weekly cycle there would be a floaty day that would probably be earmarked for more rest. The physio felt that we could do a little more progress if we moved to a three day cycle. Think in this cycle my body needs to rebuild rather than the societal cycle.

It made me think about the way “agile” ways of work slide into sprints. How often do we have a cycle for doing design work that doesn’t fit the allotted two week cycle? Sometimes we fall short. Sometimes we need a longer cycle. The acts of reflection and planning become less relevant as we are run by management cycles rather than working cycles.
