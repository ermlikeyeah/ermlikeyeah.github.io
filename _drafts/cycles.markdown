I am “recovering” at the moment from a stress fracture on my right tibia. I work closely with a physio who I have regular catch ups with. We have a programme that I am following. Less guidelines, more rules. It’s very deliberate, very gradual, very measured.

Rule number one: There is a programme.

Rule number two: Stick to the programme, do nothing more than planned, don’t push it.

Rule number three: If I feel any pain stop, take a break.

Rule number four: We review how it is going regularly.

The programme follows a cycle.

Day 1: Some stretches, pushes, jumping. A long walk or a bike session.

Day 2: A run*.

Day 3: Rest, in that do nothing or a walk.

Then I go back to day 1. Day 1 I might do the same or a little more, but nothing but a little more. Day 2 the same. Day 3 I must adhere to rest, to let my body recover, to rebuild.

I learned a lot years ago about how muscles recover and rebuild. The last six months I have learned a lot about how bones recover and rebuild. My doctor and physio want me to rest more.

Last summer I was wondering about how we “recover”, how we feel we must always be doing something rather than resting to recover. Recover as a verb versus recover as a noun. My doctor believes I need to have more rest time, let my body rebuild.
