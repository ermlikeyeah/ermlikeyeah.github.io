Two days off this week, three days working, three days full of working.

The two days off were for for the kids’ half term and My Birthday. I am now 45 years old and in these times of Stay At Home I was whistled back to my 40th, spending the day at the Barbican and going to Leicester Square to watch Spectre. The new Bond film was due to be released this week, and yeah so I’ve been enjoying the Craig era Bond films.

Last weekend I [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficeOfWilson/status/1320626102558199808) for suggestions of non-fiction/loosely based on real events/snippets of real life graphic novels. I used some birthday cash to add to my collection from the suggestions. Sharing the list here as it is quite a good list. You might find it useful. (Links are to Goodreads author and book pages.)

I swapped the chair in the shed. As long as I’ve had the shed to work from I’ve had a nifty stool from Ikea, back to it, no arms, goes up and down, swivels. My daughter put her old bedroom chair in the attic and I just fancied _a change_. The height isn’t adjustable, but it’s a comfortable height, it’s got arms and it’s pretty decent for slouching in once in a while. I felt too rigid sat most of the day on the other chair.

Assumptions, sharing early

Continuing my policy of _start finishing, finish starting_ I finished reading the last three volumes Ex Machina this week, just over _14 years_ since I read volume 2. It’s never too late.
