After expecting a follow-up call from the GP surgery’s diabetes nurse on Friday [I spent the weekend not knowing what is next](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-notes-number-2). I decided to wait until Monday and ring the GP surgery and just explain I’d been expecting a call on Friday, what do I do next?

Monday morning. Having done a lot of research around GP surgeries in my NHS Beta days I felt a little loathe to make this call, but I waited until later in the morning, 11am-ish. Avoid the rush of 8:30 callers looking for same-day appointments, avoid the people who avoid that rush, and call at a time when the receptionist is more likely to have a little breathing space.

Late yesterday I decided I was going to work from home just so I can make this I make the call, and do whatever was needed. Ahead of the call I’ve run through what I’ll say so I am super-clear and concise. The receptionist at the surgery says _Not a problem, I’ll ping the nurse a message. She’ll get back to you, maybe not today, but tomorrow at the latest._ OK OK. There is nothing more I can do. I’ve nudged. I get on with my day.

Around 3:15pm my phone rings. It’s the surgery. I am walking back to the shed as it rings. I thought I’d be sat down working when it rang. I answer the phone as I close the door to the shed.

The nurse says _hi_ and explains that the test results are mostly good, generally OK. I am good health (which _everyone_ on this journey seems to say.) The nurse asks if the doctor has already got me onto some drugs for diabetes. I say no, I saw him a couple of weeks ago and he said to get these tests and work out the drugs from there.

_Ah, well, there’s no rush. You’re showing 51 which is high blood sugar, definitely diabetic range, but isn’t terrible. Last summer you were at 44, good progress. There’s no rush. I suggest you keep doing all the good stuff you’re doing already and we check your blood again in three months._ 

I am told I’ll be referred for a retinal test and to have my feet checked. I asked the nurse to repeat those so I could write them down, half so I checked it was _retinal_ not _rectum_.

They’ll call me in three months to sort a blood test. And that’s it.

I put a note in my diary for three months’ time. _Three months on diabetes blood test_ just in case I don’t get that call. At some point I am going to get _something_ for the retinal (not rectum) test and feet check.

Life, as it has done for the last year or so, goes on as it has done. Which is right. I immediately note it’s less than four weeks until the Manchester marathon — and I haven’t run for a few days, running being one of the things that has put me in _good health_. Time for a run.
