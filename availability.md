<h2>Helping out</h2>
I am next helping out at Bradford Coder Dojo on the morning of Saturday 21 May. [Details are here](http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo). It would be great if we had more girls taking part.

<h2>Public workshops and speaking</h2>
None on the horizon.

I was going to be at [designing public services for the digital age in York](https://yorkdigitalorg.eventbrite.co.uk/), but it clashes with something. Likewise this year's [Leeds GovJam](https://leedsgovjam.wordpress.com).

I can't go, but you should if you can/fancy it.

<h2>Work</h2>
Currently booked until 27 May 2016. I am considering offers for my next challenge after that, contract or "full time".

If you've any small bits and pieces I could fit them in. [Give me a shout](/contact).

And, as always, if you want a natter you can find my details are on the [contact page](/contact).
