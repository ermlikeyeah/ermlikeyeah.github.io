<h2>Helping out, public workshops, and speaking</h2>
I am next helping out at Bradford Coder Dojo on the morning of Saturday 25 June. [Details are here](http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo). It would be great if we had more girls taking part.

No open/public workshops or talks on the horizon.

I was going to be at [designing public services for the digital age in York](https://yorkdigitalorg.eventbrite.co.uk/), but it clashes with something else I am doing. Likewise I cannot help with this year's [Leeds GovJam](https://leedsgovjam.wordpress.com) either. That shouldn't stop you though. Go if you can. You'll enjoy whichever you go to.

<h2>Work</h2>
Currently booked until 27 May 2016, and then moving on to nhs.uk.

If you've any small bits and pieces I could possibly fit them in, especially if they are *interesting*. [Give me a shout](/contact) with some info.

And, as always, if you want a natter you can find my details are on the [contact page](/contact).
