<p>
  A regular meet-up for people who are designing and making public services in and around Leeds.
</p>

<p>
  We find a space, organise the sessions for the meet-up, and invite people along.
</p>

<p>
  Sessions can be talks, workshops, videos, whatever. It's down to earth, kept small(ish), about being open amonsgt ourselves and sharing in a safe space. You will be among friends! And we hope you take something away from the meet-up.
</p>

  Previously these were run as <a href="this-is-public-design-wy">Public Design WY</a>.
