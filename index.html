<p>I am a highly experienced and successful service, user experience and interaction designer and maker of people-centred digital things, with nearly twenty years' professional experience.</p>

<p>I believe design is a process to make things that work for people, by involving people. I design stimulus to test and learn from users, and understand from research and analysis to make things continually better – and by collaborating with others as a team.</p>
