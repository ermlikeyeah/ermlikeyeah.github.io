<h2> I'm Si, a highly experienced service, interaction, and user experience designer. I help teams and organisations make digital things that people want to use and can use – by understanding people's needs.</h2>

<p>I currently work on <a href="//twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23NHSbeta">NHS Beta</a> as an interaction designer.</p>

<p>Previously I have been a lead interaction designer on HMRC's digital services, and held senior positions at <a href="//www.homeagency.co.uk">Home</a>, <a href="//www.bloomagency.co.uk">Bloom</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)">Brahm</a>. More of that stuff is <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/siwilson/">over on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I coordinate <a href="//www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/">Public Design WY</a>, a meet-up in West Yorkshire to talk about public design, help teach service design at <a href="//leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/">GovJam in Leeds</a>, guide young people to design and make through technology and digital at <a href="//bradford-coderdojo.github.io">Bradford CoderDojo</a>, and lecture at Leeds Beckett university.</p>
