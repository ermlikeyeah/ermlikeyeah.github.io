<h2>I'm Si, a highly experienced digital director and design lead.</h2>

<h3>I help people, teams and organisations work out what they need to do, help design it, and then get it made. I do strategy, team building and management, service design, product design, interaction design, to sort - and sometimes fix - the basics â€“ and then look at innovation.</h3>

<h4>I currently work as a freelancer. I am contracted as an interaction designer at <a href="//dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk">DWP Digital</a> until the middle of October 2018.</h4>

  Previously I have helped with design at <a href="//digital.nhs.uk">NHS Digital</a> on the NHS Beta programme, lead interaction designer on <a href="//hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk">HMRC's digital services</a>, and held senior positions at <a href="//www.homeagency.co.uk">Home</a>, <a href="//www.bloomagency.co.uk">Bloom</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)">Brahm</a>. More of that stuff is <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/siwilson/">over on LinkedIn</a>.

<p>
  I coordinate <a href="/this-is-public-design-wy/">Public Design WY</a> - a meet-up in West Yorkshire to talk about public design - and the Leeds cross gov design meetings, help teach service design at <a href="//gsjleeds.wordpress.com">Leeds Service Jams</a> and <a href="//leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/">Leeds GovJams</a>, guide young people to design and make with code and technology at <a href="//bradford-coderdojo.github.io">Bradford CoderDojo</a>, and lecture at Leeds Beckett university. Back in the early 2010s I spent several years giving time to help organise <a href="//leedsdigitalfestival.org">Leeds Digital Festival</a>.
