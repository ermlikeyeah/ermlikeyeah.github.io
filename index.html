<h1>Hi! I'm Si.</h1>

<h2>I am a highly experienced digital director and design lead.</h2>

<p>
  I lean on over twenty years of experience in digital and design to help people, teams and organisations work out what they need to do, design it, and make it happen. I do research, strategy, service design, product design, interaction design, team building and management.
