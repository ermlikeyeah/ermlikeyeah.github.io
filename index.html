<p> I'm Si, a highly experienced and successful service, user experience and interaction designer and maker of people-centred digital things, with nearly twenty years' professional experience. I currently work on <a href="//twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23NHSbeta">NHS Beta</a> as an interaction designer.</p>

<p>I believe design is a process to make things that work for people, by involving people. I design stimulus to test and learn from users, and understand from research and analysis to make things continually better – and by collaborating with others as a team.</p>

<p>Previously I have been a lead interaction designer at HMRC on their digital services, creative and development director at <a href="//www.homeagency.co.uk">Home</a>, studio director/chief operating officer at <a href="//www.bloomagency.co.uk">Bloom</a>, and the creative manager at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)">Brahm</a>. I have also been on boards several times. More of that stuff is <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/siwilson/">over on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I also coordinate <a href="//www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/">Public Design WY</a>, teach service design at <a href="//leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/">GovJam in Leeds</a>, teach young people to design and make through technology and digital at <a href="//www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo">Bradford CoderDojo</a>, and lecture at Leeds Beckett university.</p>

<p>In the past I have helped run Leeds Digital Festival (2011–2012), Leeds Digital Conference (2012), Leeds Digital Lunches (2011–2015), and <a href="//getintogaming.co.uk">Get into Gaming</a> with Sean Parker (2011–2013).</p>
