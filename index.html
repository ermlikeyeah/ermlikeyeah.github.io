<h2>Hi. I'm Si, a highly experienced digital director and design lead.</h2>

<p> I do research, strategy, service design, product design, interaction design, team building and management. I help people, teams and organisations work out what they need to do, design it, and make it happen.</p>

<p>Currently I work as a freelancer, contracted as an interaction designer at <a href="//dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk">DWP Digital</a> until the middle of October 2018.</p>

<p>
  In my free time I <i>i.</i> coordinate the <a href="/leedsgovdesign/">Leeds gov design meets</a> (a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services), <i>ii.</i> help teach service design at <a href="//gsjleeds.wordpress.com">Leeds Service Jams</a> and <a href="//leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/">Leeds GovJams</a>, <i>iii.</i> guide young people to design and make with code and technology at <a href="//bradford-coderdojo.github.io">Bradford CoderDojo</a>, <i>iv.</i> am a part-time lecturer on design and communication at Leeds Beckett university, <i>v.</i> write posts on <a href="all-posts/">my blog</a>.
