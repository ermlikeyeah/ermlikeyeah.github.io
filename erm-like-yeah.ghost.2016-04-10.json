While where I work has a traditional/digital split, but we're working on that. People are just taking the problem and seeing where it goes.\n\nThe other day we were going through a project - it's a campaign, there's print ads involved, there's some digital media in there, and there needs to be a little website designed and built as one of the response mechanisms.\n\nWe're talking the ads. We don't know what the media schedule is but we've got to make sure we cover how the ad will look across various sizes. 48 sheet billboard ads. Full page portrait. Half page square. Standard quarter page. Landscape quarter page strip. Portrait quarter page strip.\n\nWhat goes into the full pager that the isn't on the quarter pager? What isn't necessary? What's the focus of the ad?\n\nWe look over the digital ad placements and give them a little thought. On websites. In train station and shopping centre digital displays.\n\nA wide range of ratios - and physical sizes.\n\nWe have ideas, visuals, words, we have a priority of information (what is important, what can be dumped, what can be added in), and we have an idea of a design system.\n\nThen we look at the website.\n\n\"What's that responsive thing we need to know about?\" I am asked.\n\nI look at the ads up on the wall. Responsive design is there, staring me in the face. I point at the ads, and go through several - the 48 sheet, the full pager, the long-thin ad that runs down the right-hand third of a newspaper page.\n\n\"Think of the website like that. It's a collection of elements we rearrange, display and don't display based on the physical size of where someone is viewing the website,\" I reply.\n\nWe talk about how ten years back we were less precious about sizes, how we put priorities on margins, spacing, focus on certain elements (\"this face needs to sit just off-centre, centre-left\"), how we had some simple rules for each ad concept, and there were \"fluid\" areas in our design that could be nibbled into and expanded depending on .\n\nWe weren't particularly precious about how the ad went \"into artwork\" as long as it stuck to the rules. We could just check the ads as they came out.\n\nSo, there and then we collectively saw responsive design has been practiced by the traditional and digital arms for... well, traditional had been doing it longer, obvs.\n\nBut one last thought: That room for movement in design, that deviation also needs to exist in responsive *web* design, not just a set of static \"here's the desktop site design and here's the mobile website design\". Getting that mentality of how a \"traditional\" designer approaches designing ads across various media sizes and then takes that approach to at least a web design - that's a more important step.","html":"<p>I came into full time employment fully into the \"world of digital\", starting as a junior developer.

In train station and shopping centre digital displays.</p>\n\n<p>A wide range of ratios - and physical sizes.</p>\n\n<p>We have ideas, visuals, words, we have a priority of information (what is important, what can be dumped, what can be added in), and we have an idea of a design system.</p>\n\n<p>Then we look at the website.</p>\n\n<p>\"What's that responsive thing we need to know about?\" I am asked.</p>\n\n<p>I look at the ads up on the wall. Responsive design is there, staring me in the face. I point at the ads, and go through several - the 48 sheet, the full pager, the long-thin ad that runs down the right-hand third of a newspaper page.</p>\n\n<p>\"Think of the website like that. It's a collection of elements we rearrange, display and don't display based on the physical size of where someone is viewing the website,\" I reply.</p>\n\n<p>We talk about how ten years back we were less precious about sizes, how we put priorities on margins, spacing, focus on certain elements (\"this face needs to sit just off-centre, centre-left\"), how we had some simple rules for each ad concept, and there were \"fluid\" areas in our design that could be nibbled into and expanded depending on .</p>\n\n<p>We weren't particularly precious about how the ad went \"into artwork\" as long as it stuck to the rules. We could just check the ads as they came out.</p>\n\n<p>So, there and then we collectively saw responsive design has been practiced by the traditional and digital arms for... well, traditional had been doing it longer, obvs.</p>\n\n<p>But one last thought: That room for movement in design, that deviation also needs to exist in responsive <em>web</em> design, not just a set of static \"here's the desktop site design and here's the mobile website design\". Getting that mentality of how a \"traditional\" designer approaches designing ads across various media sizes and then takes that approach to at least a web design - that's a more important step.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-01-08T12:33:39.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-04-22T05:50:21.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-02-22T07:22:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":11,"uuid":"e0440041-f922-4bb5-b80b-b9bf5d70eeb3","title":"The brains behind spending a $25,000 marketing budget in a creative way","slug":"the-brains-behind-spending-a-25000-marketing-budget-in-a-creative-way","markdown":"Unbelievable.\n\nCool.\n\nAwesome.\n\nSome of the words used to describe how Casey Neistat decided to spend the $25,000 marketing budget for *The Secret Life of Walter Mitty* on aid for victims of typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in early November.\n\nNeistat made [a neat little film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU7rhVub0rU) of his efforts which popped up on the internet a month back.

But also clients are also pretty smart and can send through requests that already have justifiable reasoning behind them - they are <em>defined</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So, let’s move on and start to concentrate on the <em>nature of the work ahead of us</em>, rather than the <em>internal business tagging of why we are doing it</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Start with <em>How much do we know?</em> Not <em>presume</em>. <strong><em>Know</em></strong>. If we don't <em>know</em> we're in speculation territory. If we <em>know</em> we have our brief defined. Go from there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speculative work</strong>\nThis is a request that is vague, lacking in detail, purpose, strategy. Whether it is pitch work, whether it is an existing client's request there needs to be <em>knowing what we are doing and how will do it 'right'</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The process may be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Need for work comes in</li>\n<li>Analysis of the need (vetting)</li>\n<li>Strategy/approach definition</li>\n<li>Recognition of needed deliverables (ideas, costs etc)</li>\n<li>Logistics planning (limiting factors/timings/costs)</li>\n<li>Review (internally/externally)</li>\n<li>Permission to proceed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Defined work</strong>\nThis is a request that has been thought through. It arrives on your lap in shape showing it has been fed down from the speculative approach. It already has form. It tends to set up:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Idea generation</li>\n<li>Presentation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal from the <em>speculative</em> and <em>defined</em> stages is we progress to <em>production</em>. We'll save that stage for another time.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you have to do some desk work to firm up your speculative opportunity, a defined position will give you a much stronger chance to do the best work possible. The stronger the definition the greater the chance work has of actually being effective.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-02-19T07:14:10.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-14T06:09:26.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-02-19T22:11:26.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":18,"uuid":"94393f6c-8dc4-4daf-9f66-102164ef6989","title":"Think about how you tell your story.","slug":"think-about-how-you-tell-your-story","markdown":"Just sending the document over?\n\nGo through it.\n\nPresent it.\n\nIt's not about selling.

I'm Si.\n\nI am a highly experienced and successful strategist, product/service/experience/interaction designer, maker of things, and organiser of gigs. My work is usually digitally enabled and always people focused. \n\nI believe in research, knowing, teamwork and collaboration, playing to our strengths, and doing by making. Design is the process.\n\nSometimes I work against a brief. Other times from nothing and we learn where we go through discovery. And sometimes I [just hack stuff together](/side-projects), just for the hell of it (and to give my rusty coding skills a run out).\n\nI started off as a junior web developer in 1998 as job to pay the bills after learning HTML in my evenings at university.

I blamed the day before, the actual day Rosie came into our lives, for my failure.\n\nI was on garden leave and had taken the kids to school. Lovely day. As I came out of the snicket onto our road my wife was talking to our next door neighbour, with a black dog. Next door, their daughter has a black labrador, who a year back was still quite young and also lively. Here was the next door neightbour with a black dog, an excited black dog.\n\nThis dog jumped up at me. I hate it when dogs jump at me. \"HA HA!\" I laughed trying to put a positive spin on it. \"Look at this dog! It thinks it belongs to me! It's just like *your* dog!\"\n\nTurns out it wasn't our neighbour's dog. It was a dog that had been found tied to the church fence just up from our street. We called the dog warden and I spent some time *together* for a couple of hours while we waited. The dog did that dog thing where it *leant against me*, and *put its head on my lap*, and did a lot of *helpless dog eyes*.\n\nThe warden eventually arrived, he used a chip scanner, we had a chat about the databases they use to identify and track dogs. We found out she was called Rosie and there was a contact phone number - which was dead.\n\nTo cut a long story short, we kept the dog for a month instead of letting her go off to the kennels. After that month the dog's owners didn't claim her. And I (as I think it was mainly my decision) decided we should keep her, look after her, aspire to \"give her a good home\".\n\nAnd despite that disruption on that very first day when I ended up starting my final day revision for that BBC-job-I-really-wanted at 8pm and ended up going to bed at 3am for just a couple of hours kip and then flunking as the tiredness, the pressure, the expectancy after waiting years for this chance combined was too much and the adrenaline just didn't make up for tha-- Ah, it wasn't the dog's fault I bummed out. It was my err, not the disruption of the dog entering our lives just then.\n\nThe dog did disrupt my prep, and the dog has continued to be a disruption, and in good ways.\n\nThe dog's routine, the dog's need for routine (routine means going out three times a day, going out means minimising dog's bounciness), has had a positive effect.\n\nI love walking and I do love exercise. I have kept trying for the past few years to get a bit more exercise into my week, but I'm too much of a slave to my work/desk. I'm the sort of person that needs a push, the sort of person gamification of physical activity should (and does) target. And having a dog is that catalyst.\n\nMost mornings I take it for a walk, usually on a nearly-4km route down to the canal (sometimes [tracked using Runkeeper](http://runkeeper.com/user/IdleSi/profile)). Already before work I am clocking up exercise, getting some fresh in, and a chance for a think-walk at the start of the day. Clear my lungs, stretch my legs, get a few things straight and even out of my head. Sure getting up at six can be a bit suck-ass, but means I *have* to go to bed early-ish the night before, not after half ten - again, a win for someone who regularly stayed up past midnight, sometimes past one.\n\nIf I work from home the dog's routine forces me to take her out at lunch - and forces me to take a break then. I am awful for sitting down at the start of the day and then only getting up for refreshment trips. And again, time up about, time clearing my head - and a chance to laugh at the dog playing.\n\nLate afternoon, it's the same. If I am working out of the house I get to take her to a park for half an hour. Again, flexing the leg muscles, getting some light and air, but also a good chance to give my mind the chance to take a breather, to catch up.\n\nYou'll be gathering that our dog has been GREAT for my mind and well-being. And it's a shame it's taken a dog to kick me out of my work-slave habits.\n\nI hate gossip and gossiping, but I love people watching. The dog's fantastic for that as well. The characters you meet.\n\nThe morning walk: The woman who works for the RSPCA. The guy down on the field with the golf club, who whacks balls for his dog to chase. The mum who leaves the house for her dog walk on the Rec so her kids get ready. And very rarely do I have to explain who I am or what I do. We just wish each other a \"Good morning!\" and have a brief natter briefly about some little life thing.\n\nThe dog has even provided with me with teh inspiration and the excuse to experiment with some tech.\n\n*\"Runkeeper tells me I travel 3.8km, but the dog goes over there, over there, all over. Where does the dog go? How further than me does it run?*\n\nSo I got an old Android phone to create a MVP dog GPS tracker system.\n\nAnd I've had immense fun doing that, something I'd presume people thought I'd do as my job but don't because... my jobs haven't give me the chance to do that. Making that dog tracker, learning from it, improving it (\"Oh. The dog likes to jump into the canal, so it needs to be waterfproof.\"), has introduced me to playing with more physical tech, gathering data, testing in a 'real environment', and I've talked with some pretty clever folk off the back of it.\n\nThe dog has also made me think of things from another species' point of view. While I practice a user-centred approach to design (which involves understanding the habits of people) that has always been about just that: people. Even when I worked on Pets at Home stuff (years back), that was just basically retail for humans. Rosie has made me think about empathising with other *beings*, that aren't as predictable and challenges your idea of assumptions - which sharpens your questioning and researching.\n\nNow, as I type this from my garage-converted-into-a-mini-office the dog is asleep on the first chair my wife and I bought for our previous home (which the dog has 'claimed').\n\nWhen it's just me and the dog in the house, that's where she tends to go, curled up, and sometimes breathing deeply, even snoring. Occasionally she is asleep and starts wimpering in her sleep, moving her legs. Part of me is thinking \"If only I could see her dreams\" and \"When will we understand dogs' langauge?\", and other animals' languages for that matter. Which is exciting!\n\nThe dog's been a disruption, but she's been a positive disruption. The dog has been a stimulus for me in a number of ways I couldn't have predicted. Even if she does snore, which I would previously have said was the most human of traits.","html":"<p>Today marks a year since our dog, Rosie, entered our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, today marks a year <em>and one day</em> since our dog, Rosie, entered our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Today actually marks a year since I went to the BBC over in Manchester for an interview - which I faffed up.

Again, flexing the leg muscles, getting some light and air, but also a good chance to give my mind the chance to take a breather, to catch up.</p>\n\n<p>You'll be gathering that our dog has been GREAT for my mind and well-being. And it's a shame it's taken a dog to kick me out of my work-slave habits.</p>\n\n<p>I hate gossip and gossiping, but I love people watching. The dog's fantastic for that as well. The characters you meet.</p>\n\n<p>The morning walk: The woman who works for the RSPCA. The guy down on the field with the golf club, who whacks balls for his dog to chase. The mum who leaves the house for her dog walk on the Rec so her kids get ready. And very rarely do I have to explain who I am or what I do. We just wish each other a \"Good morning!\" and have a brief natter briefly about some little life thing.</p>\n\n<p>The dog has even provided with me with teh inspiration and the excuse to experiment with some tech.</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Runkeeper tells me I travel 3.8km, but the dog goes over there, over there, all over. Where does the dog go? How further than me does it run?</em></p>\n\n<p>So I got an old Android phone to create a MVP dog GPS tracker system.</p>\n\n<p>And I've had immense fun doing that, something I'd presume people thought I'd do as my job but don't because... my jobs haven't give me the chance to do that. Making that dog tracker, learning from it, improving it (\"Oh. The dog likes to jump into the canal, so it needs to be waterfproof.\"), has introduced me to playing with more physical tech, gathering data, testing in a 'real environment', and I've talked with some pretty clever folk off the back of it.</p>\n\n<p>The dog has also made me think of things from another species' point of view. While I practice a user-centred approach to design (which involves understanding the habits of people) that has always been about just that: people. Even when I worked on Pets at Home stuff (years back), that was just basically retail for humans. Rosie has made me think about empathising with other <em>beings</em>, that aren't as predictable and challenges your idea of assumptions - which sharpens your questioning and researching.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as I type this from my garage-converted-into-a-mini-office the dog is asleep on the first chair my wife and I bought for our previous home (which the dog has 'claimed').</p>\n\n<p>When it's just me and the dog in the house, that's where she tends to go, curled up, and sometimes breathing deeply, even snoring. Occasionally she is asleep and starts wimpering in her sleep, moving her legs. Part of me is thinking \"If only I could see her dreams\" and \"When will we understand dogs' langauge?\", and other animals' languages for that matter. Which is exciting!</p>\n\n<p>The dog's been a disruption, but she's been a positive disruption. The dog has been a stimulus for me in a number of ways I couldn't have predicted. Even if she does snore, which I would previously have said was the most human of traits.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-05-22T17:06:50.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-14T06:01:57.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-05-01T08:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":26,"uuid":"0ef557c2-677b-4776-b5e5-874540c81fb1","title":"Next","slug":"next","markdown":"A couple of weeks back I shared [I'd been let go from my job](/let-go/).

To which they were bemused. And you may be too, so I'll explain - but beware, there are spoilers ahead.\n\nThe first two-thirds of the film, which sit on the line between thriller and action, and then bobbed from side to side, dipping into both as needed is excellent.\n\n(The third act is a bit more predictably straightforward and bombastic, but it does that in a well, entertaining fashion.)\n\nWhile making the film the directors, the Russo brothers weren't candid about their intention to carry nods to 70s conspiracy thrillers.\n\nAnd, man!, I loved them saying that! \nSeeking inspiration from the genre containing some of my fave films: All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, The Conversation, and the not-so-well-known Winter Kills (which has an amazing production story, documented in [Who Killed Winter Kills?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0AMKntDQZ8)). The 70s, particularly its conspiracy genre, was a time Hollywood was funding some interesting projects shrouded in intrigue and paranoia, and questioning the real world - resulting in some great films.\n\nAnd the Russos were talking about this about the same time Iron Man 3 came out, itself a great piece of fun, a Marvelised 80s buddy flick. The Avengers, Iron Man 3 and, to a lesser extent, Thor, had started to nudge Marvel's films firmly into firmly interesting territory, and Captain America 2 looked to increase that feeling.\n\nShortly afterwards Robert Redford was cast as Alexander Pierce in the film. Redford is a great actor, a noted experienced head, but also a defining figure in the 70s conspiracy thrillers (All the President's Men and Three Days of the Condor). This move definitely appealed to an older audience - or more cinema-savvy viewers. \n\nWhat would Pierce's role be? An introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe to mark a \"handing over\", like he'll be the \"next Nick Fury\" - or would it be something else? Pierce's absence from the Winter Soldier's promotional material left this question hanging open tantalisingly.\n\nRedford plays his chracter of Pierce with all the charmful authority you'd expect from, well, Robert Redford. And it makes sense that Robert Redford is in charge of the world's security.\n\nBut when the reveal of Pierce as the big bad comes it isn't that revelatory. It's an about-face you suspect is coming, because having Robert Redford be a force for all good would be too easy, too obvious for a Marvel, who seem to be progressively contriving a more startling twist with each new film.\n\nThe problem Marvel faced and will continue to face  - not just from a general expectancy from film watchers, but especially themselves since Iron Man 3 - is people expect an about-face. It's a habit, an expectancy of modern cinema that the audience will witness a twist, a pivot, something unexpected. Marvel, of anyone, played this masterfully in the marketing and lead up to the release of Iron Man 3.\n\n*Ben Kingsley is the Mandarin!* the film's marketing told you. It didn't hide that. Just look at that poster! \"You won't see me coming\" was Kinglsey's much-loved ominous line from the film's trailer.\n\nWatch Iron Man 3 and you walk away with a slightly different perspective: Kingsley's character in the film turns out to be an actor playing the Mandarin. It's a twist no-one saw coming (c'mon - no-one did), and the line in the trailer now carries an air of meta ominousity for anyone who has seen the film. So, Redford being the Big Bad: it's the expected twist.\n\nBut still, having Robert Redford play the bad is so awesome because... Robert Redford!\n\nThe scene when it is finally laid bare that Pierce/Redford is the film's bad is also a masterly scene in the film. Pierce's calmness in the presence of the Winter Soldier is unnerving. And the \"I wish you had knocked\" line leads into a fantastic shot, cutting to outside the room, the home, the audience looking into Pierce's home at nighttime - as they see Pierce execute his maid, against a static driven score.\n\nIn those couple of minutes the comic book world is dipped so deeply into the 70s films the Russos said they would borrow from. And it's a fantastic, fantastic moment, laden with darkness of scene (nighttime, shadows) and character heightened by Redford's presence - and possibly beyond most of the people younger than 21 at the showing we were at.\n\nExpectancy - or at least building expectancy - is something Marvel do well (littered above are a few references to the marketing of their films) and their regular during- and post-credits scenes aid that. They tease so, so well! The Winter Soldier's during-credits scene sets up something already anticipated, the second Avengers film. But the post-credits scene from the Winter Solider is the most exciting for me. This scene in the epilogue for the film I have just seen, and the prologue for something we don't know about yet. (As my son said: \"Dad. He looks *angry*.\" And, by God, he does.)\n\nThis translates into confidence for Marvel's films at the moment, and their upcoming slate just heightens that: Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers 2, and Ant Man. That last film in particular is the most intriguing from a studio knowing how to entertain satisfyingly working with a highly confident director of thrillingly entertaining films, Edgar Wright. Heck, the reason I want to see Ant Man? Because Edgar Wright.\n\nAnd Marvel and Wright have already got a great cast together for Ant Man, including an actor in the same ilk as Redford: Michael Douglas. But please don't make him the big bad of Ant Man. Why? Because we'll be expecting it now. Because Robert Redford.","html":"<p>We've been to see <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/\">Captain American: The Winter Soldier</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In short it's a rollicking adventure mainly, as I explained to my kids, \"because Robert Redford!\".

Her point was one I've come across a bit over the years, working in agencies and working with clients.\n\nMy friend is a marketing head and had brand guidelines to work from. She's got a pretty clear communication need, and it's tied into a business metric so she's got to do something that engages.\n\nHer next task was to put her brief to a couple of agencies on her business's roster when she caught up with them next, just to get their feedback.\n\nShe felt there was a need to do something outside of the guidelines' guidance for this job to really work, and yet felt tied to the guidelines.  She was in an unsure middle ground where the guidelines didn't help her communication needs.\n\nWhether its \"the guidelines were too vague\" or \"the guidelines are too restrictive\" this is a common story in communications world.\n\nI had one big point here which I went through with her, but I'll share with you as well.\n\nBrand guidelines are are just that: *guide*lines for a *brand*. They are there to guide, to point the brand in the right direction.\n\nBrand guidelines provide consistency wherever possible. \n\nBut brand guidelines are not rules. Nor are they laws.\n\nBrand guidelines are (usually) far from exhaustive in what they cover and address.\n\nAt the core of them should be a clarity of the idea, the concept of what your brand \"stands for\", how it \"feels\", give examples of how to place and lay out the logo, the font to use, the rules and relationships between the brand elements, the colour palette (usually with CYMK references). All that stuff.\n\nBrand guidelines help you design when they can.\n\nAt the bottom level they are there to set the scene and give you some elements for your *brand* to work with.\n\nMaybe people expect too much from brand guidelines. But there is another bigger problem: People read them too literally.\n\nThe best guidelines have an opening page that give an overview of the feel of the brand (and maybe tell the story of how that was arrived at), and how the brand can connect with the brand's audience, talking about things like language and tone. What follows? The guidelines, usually for the logo.\n\nA lot of people say that digital as a medium (or a mass of mediums) is where brand guidelines often fall short. Short-minded.\n\nBrand guidelines don't usually cover a lot of other mediums, especially moving image (such as television) and anyone who specialises in PR would have their take. But then they are *brand* guidelines. Brand guidelines are usually designed with print work in mind.\n\nYour brand and how it manifests and is represented across all mediums **is important**. But your brand is much more than just logos, colour schemes, and taglines.\n\nYour brand defines how you talk to your audience (and/or your target audience) and that could never be a constant. There needs to be room for adaptation and improvisation on where the brand is going in and those driving it need to be comfortable, confident.\n\nThe moving image is a great example, maybe the greatest, potentially most powerful example, where an ad can tell a story that gets across the brand, with the  logo probably just popping up at the end along with the campaign message. But the ad will still present the brand in an interpreted way.\n\nAnd there are times when hacking, breaking the visual rules is something I'd accept and push for if it connected with audiences.\n\n(I've had several client job like this recently where we needed to speak to an audience through a web presence, but a solution that was \"heavily branded\", as per their actually quite thorough guidelines, would have been more off-putting than engaging. So we all agreed to capture the essence of the brand in the overall language design.)\n\nI am not saying this as a 'designer' who doesn't want to be bound by rules others have set down. I have worked with handed down guidelines and I have worked on creating guidelines - there has to be respect for decent guidelines.\n\nA lot of the time the commonality brand guidelines provides shared understanding and approaches. They do provide a common thread, as you'd expect good guidance to.\n\nIf there is a point where the brand guidelines do not serve a purpose as something that is oft-referred to, then is it time to relook at the brand and what guides them - even if that is putting down \"[Anything goes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1H9eKWPGRo)\"?\n\nWhat I am saying: Know your brand and know your brand is something beyond just being a logo and a strapline.

Take guidelines as a starting point to explore relevant ideas, within those guidelines, around those guidelines and outside of those guidelines. And I ask that whether you're using them - or if you are creating them in the first place.","html":"<p>I had a chat a few weeks back with a friend who works \"client side\", seeking some advice. Her point was one I've come across a bit over the years, working in agencies and working with clients.</p>\n\n<p>My friend is a marketing head and had brand guidelines to work from. She's got a pretty clear communication need, and it's tied into a business metric so she's got to do something that engages.</p>\n\n<p>Her next task was to put her brief to a couple of agencies on her business's roster when she caught up with them next, just to get their feedback.</p>\n\n<p>She felt there was a need to do something outside of the guidelines' guidance for this job to really work, and yet felt tied to the guidelines.  She was in an unsure middle ground where the guidelines didn't help her communication needs.</p>\n\n<p>Whether its \"the guidelines were too vague\" or \"the guidelines are too restrictive\" this is a common story in communications world.</p>\n\n<p>I had one big point here which I went through with her, but I'll share with you as well.</p>\n\n<p>Brand guidelines are are just that: <em>guide</em>lines for a <em>brand</em>. They are there to guide, to point the brand in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Brand guidelines provide consistency wherever possible. </p>\n\n<p>But brand guidelines are not rules. Nor are they laws.</p>\n\n<p>Brand guidelines are (usually) far from exhaustive in what they cover and address.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of them should be a clarity of the idea, the concept of what your brand \"stands for\", how it \"feels\", give examples of how to place and lay out the logo, the font to use, the rules and relationships between the brand elements, the colour palette (usually with CYMK references). All that stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Brand guidelines help you design when they can.</p>\n\n<p>At the bottom level they are there to set the scene and give you some elements for your <em>brand</em> to work with.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe people expect too much from brand guidelines. But there is another bigger problem: People read them too literally.</p>\n\n<p>The best guidelines have an opening page that give an overview of the feel of the brand (and maybe tell the story of how that was arrived at), and how the brand can connect with the brand's audience, talking about things like language and tone. What follows? The guidelines, usually for the logo.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people say that digital as a medium (or a mass of mediums) is where brand guidelines often fall short. Short-minded.</p>\n\n<p>Brand guidelines don't usually cover a lot of other mediums, especially moving image (such as television) and anyone who specialises in PR would have their take. But then they are <em>brand</em> guidelines. Brand guidelines are usually designed with print work in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Your brand and how it manifests and is represented across all mediums <strong>is important</strong>. But your brand is much more than just logos, colour schemes, and taglines.</p>\n\n<p>Your brand defines how you talk to your audience (and/or your target audience) and that could never be a constant. There needs to be room for adaptation and improvisation on where the brand is going in and those driving it need to be comfortable, confident.</p>\n\n<p>The moving image is a great example, maybe the greatest, potentially most powerful example, where an ad can tell a story that gets across the brand, with the  logo probably just popping up at the end along with the campaign message. But the ad will still present the brand in an interpreted way.</p>\n\n<p>And there are times when hacking, breaking the visual rules is something I'd accept and push for if it connected with audiences.</p>\n\n<p>(I've had several client job like this recently where we needed to speak to an audience through a web presence, but a solution that was \"heavily branded\", as per their actually quite thorough guidelines, would have been more off-putting than engaging. So we all agreed to capture the essence of the brand in the overall language design.)</p>\n\n<p>I am not saying this as a 'designer' who doesn't want to be bound by rules others have set down. I have worked with handed down guidelines and I have worked on creating guidelines - there has to be respect for decent guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the time the commonality brand guidelines provides shared understanding and approaches. They do provide a common thread, as you'd expect good guidance to.</p>\n\n<p>If there is a point where the brand guidelines do not serve a purpose as something that is oft-referred to, then is it time to relook at the brand and what guides them - even if that is putting down \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1H9eKWPGRo\">Anything goes</a>\"?</p>\n\n<p>What I am saying: Know your brand and know your brand is something beyond just being a logo and a strapline. Understand how you talk to your audiences and potential audiences. Take guidelines as a starting point to explore relevant ideas, within those guidelines, around those guidelines and outside of those guidelines. And I ask that whether you're using them - or if you are creating them in the first place.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-05-28T15:01:05.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-06-14T06:02:20.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-04-17T10:30:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":30,"uuid":"48102fa1-aabe-4567-ae1a-e027dde8d21a","title":"Odd spaces","slug":"odd-spaces","markdown":"Advertising may be coming to your thermostat and lots of other strange places, courtesy of Google [ran a recent piece in the WSJ](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/21/google-predicts-ads-in-odd-spots-like-thermostats/).\n\nThe jist was Google had documented they could put ads on \"refrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, and watches, to name just a few possibilities.\" Which isn't that relevatory.

My answer: simply I wanted to use something a) I could assume most people in the room were aware of, even used, and b) I wanted to keep the relational elements within the presentation to a minimum. I didn't want people to walk away dazed. I wanted them to come away amazed. And the point *3% of data is Facebook's* is pretty amazing to me.\n\nThe shot of the hadron collider at the end was deliberately the only picture I used. I wanted to have some impact.

Thinking about habits YouTube came up early as a preferred 'search engine' for answers, and video was thought to be ideal to create and tell create engaging, connecting stories that felt *real*.\n\nThere was also how the 'digital' path could end with a user actually using their mobile device as a communication device, notably Facebook style chat, forums, and also the sometimes yet obviously missed use for phone calls and SMSes!\n\nThe idea of *mental heath and wellbeing* was also given due attention. The phrase 'mental health' isn't about 'bad'. On its own it should be about an appraisal of state - but is that how the public perceives it? Is \"mental health\" associated only with 'issues'? Again, something else to consider.\n\nWith the brief for the product to be aimed at young adults aged between 12 and 19, there was some illuminating discussion about whether the 'target audience' is a slight red herring: Is that the full audience? After some discussion we explored the idea of the site offering guidance, understanding, and assurance to people, but also people who are around that group, such as parents who might not understand their own chidren and would seek the internet to give them answers.\n\n![Tone](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s40/sh/3e1c5b91-322d-4e71-a1b2-ccad552c3709/9e2acd0476a8fc0ff3762e6582129d38/res/a851cc96-7ccb-4123-9eaf-69180211034b/IMG_20140618_123739~2.jpeg?resizeSmall&width=832)\n\nThe tone of how the product speaks *with* - and *to* when needs be - its audience was also key.

But how absurd does that sound? This is 2014.”\n\nQuick bit of background: I used to do front-end code years ago. I started my career as a coder but drifted away to more designing and managing rather than building. I’ve done a bit of dabbling here and there over the years (outside of markup in WordPress etc), but nothing that would make me comfortably say I was “a good front-ender” like I did back in 2000.\n\nWork-wise recently I’ve been sewn down with a lot of strategy, user experience stuff, and production management. I am far from complaining here: it’s all good stuff, enjoyable.\n\nThe relationship between the ‘designer(s)’ and the ‘builder(s)’, the team that creates something, is a process *I* feel can/should be bridged and enhanced by both of those roles working together, having shared knowledge and appreciation of the other's role and skills.\n\nExample: I used a recent project as an excuse to create some in-browser wireframes using [Twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), just for the heck of it. Could I do it? I could and I would, eventually. It was a learning experience that has helped me, understand deeper Twitter bootstrap.\n\nI followed up that experience pretty quickly, using the experience to hack together a holding site (well, page) for my [my company](http://www.studioofthings.com/). And I’ve used that initial website as an opportunity to focus, to create a reason to try new stuff, with iterations of the website. (It hasn't gone *that* far yet. Because time.)\n\nSo, to go back to the start: We were talking about [our local council - Bradford - website](http://www.bradford.gov.uk).\n\nI’ve been onto the council’s website earlier today with a specific goal, and on my laptop. Mindful of my chum’s little rant, I curiously had a quick go on the website on my 7 inch tablet and my mobile phone at the same time, to see where my chum was coming from. I could tolerate it, the things they found annoying - but then I spend a lot of time fiddling, evaluating, testing.\n\nBut, still, I could see their point. It is a pain in the ass. And it’s not a point I’d just heard from them. Others had piped up with similar, others who don't work in the 'world of digital’ but are nonetheless inhabitants of this modern world where engagement, the diseemination of information is through technology.\n\n>“Here, Si, you work on websites. Why is it when I go to some websites they know I am on my iPhone yet the council website just shows me a normal website?”\n\nI know why that is, but I don't know *why* that isn't.\n\nLunchtime I dound myself with a little “leftover time” (y’know, after lunch was made and eaten) - and my friend's chat was at the back of my mind. How hard could it be to 'fix' the website so it displays on a mobile phone? Could I hack together a version of the council’s website in whatever was left over from my lunch break? I had the time to have a go.\n\nA quick nip to the website, selecting a content page, and then viewing the page’s source code was the starting point.\n\nIn the half an hour of my lunch break left over I had taken a local copy of the page, fired up Brackets, sketched the page visual and code structure, included some immediate (and naughty) hide code, and got to work on the CSS for the header, main content, and footer.\n\nIt wasn't a massive job - there wasn’t time for it to be. And, sure, the approach I took was very much a hacked one, there are flaws. I worked with the HTML in place. My CSS was definitely hacks (not 'best practice'. By the end of half an hour I'd broken the footer starting to do some more detailed faffing. And didn't create versions of my code, so couldn't quickly go back to a version that 'worked'.\n\nBut my goal was quite clear: To create a version of that page that displayed better on a mobile phone screen within half an hour. I wasn’t after the leanest code or a redesign (although I did use up the size of the breadcrumb slightly, just for the heck of it). And I did it.\n\nExperimenting, hacking, recycling, trying new ways to understand how things can be made, should be part and parcel of what we do - and not just 'we' as people that make digital things, but people as people.\n\nFour takeaways for me:\n\n* Could the people who actually own/run the council website just have a go like this?\n* It wasn't too bad hacking together a mobile version in a lunch. What else out there could I hack together into a mobile friendly format? (The [WY Metro](http://www.wymetro.com) timetables are something I regularly use.)\n* Could I extend this “half hour hacks” into a regular programme, maybe like [Alex Proba](http://alexproba.com/)'s [a poster a day project](http://a-poster-a-day.tumblr.com/)?\n* What thing out there already do you think could be improved with a little jiggery-pokery? Or maybe a redesign/rebuild. Could you have a go yourself? We'll be talking about this at the next [Leeds Digital Lunch](/leeds-digital-lunch).","html":"<blockquote>\n  <p>“I hate it.

I am far from complaining here: it’s all good stuff, enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>The relationship between the ‘designer(s)’ and the ‘builder(s)’, the team that creates something, is a process <em>I</em> feel can/should be bridged and enhanced by both of those roles working together, having shared knowledge and appreciation of the other's role and skills.</p>\n\n<p>Example: I used a recent project as an excuse to create some in-browser wireframes using <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Twitter bootstrap</a>, just for the heck of it. Could I do it? I could and I would, eventually. It was a learning experience that has helped me, understand deeper Twitter bootstrap.</p>\n\n<p>I followed up that experience pretty quickly, using the experience to hack together a holding site (well, page) for my <a href=\"http://www.studioofthings.com/\">my company</a>. And I’ve used that initial website as an opportunity to focus, to create a reason to try new stuff, with iterations of the website. (It hasn't gone <em>that</em> far yet. Because time.)</p>\n\n<p>So, to go back to the start: We were talking about <a href=\"http://www.bradford.gov.uk\">our local council - Bradford - website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been onto the council’s website earlier today with a specific goal, and on my laptop. Mindful of my chum’s little rant, I curiously had a quick go on the website on my 7 inch tablet and my mobile phone at the same time, to see where my chum was coming from. I could tolerate it, the things they found annoying - but then I spend a lot of time fiddling, evaluating, testing.</p>\n\n<p>But, still, I could see their point. It is a pain in the ass. And it’s not a point I’d just heard from them. Others had piped up with similar, others who don't work in the 'world of digital’ but are nonetheless inhabitants of this modern world where engagement, the diseemination of information is through technology.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Here, Si, you work on websites. Why is it when I go to some websites they know I am on my iPhone yet the council website just shows me a normal website?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know why that is, but I don't know <em>why</em> that isn't.</p>\n\n<p>Lunchtime I dound myself with a little “leftover time” (y’know, after lunch was made and eaten) - and my friend's chat was at the back of my mind. How hard could it be to 'fix' the website so it displays on a mobile phone? Could I hack together a version of the council’s website in whatever was left over from my lunch break? I had the time to have a go.</p>\n\n<p>A quick nip to the website, selecting a content page, and then viewing the page’s source code was the starting point.</p>\n\n<p>In the half an hour of my lunch break left over I had taken a local copy of the page, fired up Brackets, sketched the page visual and code structure, included some immediate (and naughty) hide code, and got to work on the CSS for the header, main content, and footer.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't a massive job - there wasn’t time for it to be. And, sure, the approach I took was very much a hacked one, there are flaws. I worked with the HTML in place. My CSS was definitely hacks (not 'best practice'. By the end of half an hour I'd broken the footer starting to do some more detailed faffing. And didn't create versions of my code, so couldn't quickly go back to a version that 'worked'.</p>\n\n<p>But my goal was quite clear: To create a version of that page that displayed better on a mobile phone screen within half an hour. I wasn’t after the leanest code or a redesign (although I did use up the size of the breadcrumb slightly, just for the heck of it). And I did it.</p>\n\n<p>Experimenting, hacking, recycling, trying new ways to understand how things can be made, should be part and parcel of what we do - and not just 'we' as people that make digital things, but people as people.</p>\n\n<p>Four takeaways for me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Could the people who actually own/run the council website just have a go like this?</li>\n<li>It wasn't too bad hacking together a mobile version in a lunch. What else out there could I hack together into a mobile friendly format? (The <a href=\"http://www.wymetro.com\">WY Metro</a> timetables are something I regularly use.)</li>\n<li>Could I extend this “half hour hacks” into a regular programme, maybe like <a href=\"http://alexproba.com/\">Alex Proba</a>'s <a href=\"http://a-poster-a-day.tumblr.com/\">a poster a day project</a>?</li>\n<li>What thing out there already do you think could be improved with a little jiggery-pokery? Or maybe a redesign/rebuild. Could you have a go yourself? We'll be talking about this at the next <a href=\"/leeds-digital-lunch\">Leeds Digital Lunch</a>.</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-07-19T05:45:29.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-24T15:48:41.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-07-19T05:55:10.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":41,"uuid":"b6a9b336-46fb-49e9-acd7-964ec51a250a","title":"Weathering a two hour hack","slug":"weathering-a-two-hour-hack","markdown":"After finding a little time [Friday lunchtime to hack about with Bradford council's website stylesheets](/try-something-new-to-something-already-there/), I found myself with some unexpected downtime today as well.\n\nTowards the end of last week there were threats of thunderstorms across the UK.

Listing the data simply and in chronoligical order would help me (and anyone I shared the hack with) find events to go to and help recognise when I could organise events myself by knowing when to avoid. It was also a good chance to see how malleable Eventbrite’s data was and test my PHP skills.\n\nThe problem back then was getting the data from Eventbrite wasn’t as straightforward as I thought. I went in blindly thinking \"I can just grab this data, sort it, splat it on screen, job done\".\n\nInstead of being able to (reasonably easily) ask the Eventbrite API for all the events near Leeds (even by giving a longitude and latitude and then a maximum distance from that), Eventbrite generates location data as through RSS feeds. And pretty much *all the data* I needed was scrunched together and held within *one field* within that feed.\n\nI needed to parse the feed's XML - simple enough - and then write a routine to parse the specific XML field to break *that* down, so I had location, date, time, etc as separate elements. Strewth!\n\nWhile I had PHP as a good part of my life 10 years back, after a few years of minimal coding my PHP skills were rusty. I spent about half a day playing around, and got something spat out which was bug ridden. But my enthusiasm for the idea waned. Did I really need to spend spare time or down time fuddling about? I decided there were other things to do, other things I could do, other things that wouldn't have me grimacing at the Macbook - as much anyway.\n\nSince then I’ve done lots of work stuff, some of which I've done some coding as a natural occurance of the work, and been lucky to have the chances to do some hacking (one of the joys of [running my own thing](http://www.studioofthings.com/)). Some of those hacks I blogged about:\n\n* A couple of hours writing [a web app that tells me if I can hang the washing out](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/weathering-a-two-hour-hack/)\n* A lunchtime [hacking my local council’s website’s stylesheet to create a responsive version](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/try-something-new-to-something-already-there/).\n\nAll that work all that stuff has sharpened my skills again - and helped push on the shape of this abandoned idea resting at the back of my mind.\n\nIt's not the only idea I've had in the holding bay of my brain. Sometimes ideas do need sketching initially and then leaving. Over time you come up with some of what to do, either by working out what you need to do, simply finding the time, finding someone who can help you, or whether to dump them. (I've hinted previously about the idea of \"[think-walks](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/a-dog-one-year-on/)\", taking an idea with you on a walk.)\n\nSo, Sunday breakfast the rest of the family were upstairs watching and playing with various screens. I had nothng better to do, but thought I'd open up my Macbook and have a go at the Eventbrite project again, from scratch. I felt I'd thought it through a bit more - learning from my initial failure a few months back and building on top of that.\n\nIn 90 minutes (which is longer than your average breakfast, but it was Sunday) I’d managed to get the Leeds data from Eventbrite, slurped in and spat crudely and unordered into the browser, with no errors. Progress! I marked the occasion with a celebratory tweet!\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Quick brekkie hack: list upcoming Leeds events on Eventbrite.

This is a evolution that I had planned as well, especially from chats with busy event creating people like [Emma Bearman](https://twitter.com/EmmaMBearman) who had mentioned how they have to do so much date checking for *other events* as part of planning their own events.\n\nIn the afternoon I grabbed a couple of hours to get data from Lanyrd merged in with Eventbrite data. Lanyrd seemed a small grab - there wasn't lots of data there, but I knew Leeds folk used/loved it (looking at you, [Matt Edgar](http://mattedgar.com/)) and it would also be a good test subject for scaling the data imports. This was easier than I thought, as Lanyrd has RSS feeds much like Eventbrite (albeit formatted neater).\n\nAt the same time as the feeds' locations were variables I did a little tweak so I could get, and look at, Bradford data to go with the Leeds data. (I live in Bradford.)\n\nBy the end of Sunday I'd spent about four hours scattered over breakfast and gaps between dog walks, cooking meals, eating meals, going to the gym, and the like. It felt like a highly productive day and also a relaxing day.\n\nMonday, back to work, but I found 90 minutes over breakfast to hook the system up to Meetup, add Manchester and New York data sources, and create a version that generated static HTML files to save the server load. In the evening I used 90 minutes to prettify the pages (responsively, naturally).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>And now orders by chrono. Magic.

(If you're looking above adding up, there's a couple of small things not noted above.)\n\nThis isn't a huge amount of time given how quickly I got a minimum viable product out (less than half a day on Sunday) and the number of progresions already to push the original product forward. I've had fun scrapping with XML and designing within the browser (Photoshop was only used to grab some colour references).\n\nIt *will* help me find events to go to - and help me find appropriate times to hold my own events.

This is a evolution that I had planned as well, especially from chats with busy event creating people like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmaMBearman\">Emma Bearman</a> who had mentioned how they have to do so much date checking for <em>other events</em> as part of planning their own events.</p>\n\n<p>In the afternoon I grabbed a couple of hours to get data from Lanyrd merged in with Eventbrite data. Lanyrd seemed a small grab - there wasn't lots of data there, but I knew Leeds folk used/loved it (looking at you, <a href=\"http://mattedgar.com/\">Matt Edgar</a>) and it would also be a good test subject for scaling the data imports. This was easier than I thought, as Lanyrd has RSS feeds much like Eventbrite (albeit formatted neater).</p>\n\n<p>At the same time as the feeds' locations were variables I did a little tweak so I could get, and look at, Bradford data to go with the Leeds data. (I live in Bradford.)</p>\n\n<p>By the end of Sunday I'd spent about four hours scattered over breakfast and gaps between dog walks, cooking meals, eating meals, going to the gym, and the like. It felt like a highly productive day and also a relaxing day.</p>\n\n<p>Monday, back to work, but I found 90 minutes over breakfast to hook the system up to Meetup, add Manchester and New York data sources, and create a version that generated static HTML files to save the server load. In the evening I used 90 minutes to prettify the pages (responsively, naturally).</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>And now orders by chrono. Magic.

And their advice was right. It does read better.

They all take a couple of hours extra during the month to sort stuff. It's nothing massive, but does add up to a couple of \"working days\" every month, if that's your preferred math unit.\n\nOff the back of my update this morning I was asked how long I spend on these activities, and then \"Why do you give up so much of your own time, and for free?\". Another linked question: \"Why do you promote these activities?\"\n\nI regularly get asked to \"do things for free\", \"attend things for free\". To be fair, most of them *are* interesting. I have just become very weary of committing to much.\n\nFirstly, I work for myself, which affords me freedom and equally affords me restraint - depending on workflow and cashflow.\n\nSecondly, some of the things I get asked to do I believe are - and I am politely wording this - better suited to someone to being paid to do them.\n\nThirdly, tied into the above, I actually think there's *a lot* of \"attend for free\" events at the moment, whether that's an extension of the \"big society\" mentality or access flow in the other direction, organisations reaching outwards.\n\nFinally, if I am going to do stuff \"for free\" I am giving my (rare evenings and weekend usually spent with my family) time up I want to do things that can make a change.\n\nIn each of the three cases I added onto my LinkedIn profile this morning I was asked if I would be able to help out (and quite politely in every case). There was no presumption I would say yes, just a \"it'd be great if you could spare some time and get involved\". Each request also emphasised it'd be good to have me on board with my experience.\n\nI could have said no. I could have easily said no. I do say no to giving time up for free a bit these days. I sometimes say \"yes, no problemo!\" And rarely I say yes but say it'll have wait a little bit until my plate is less full. (And sometimes the offerer says no in return, usually because of their own time pressures.) But I never say no or yes straight away. I like to consider these things.\n\nBut I did say yes to those three offers. Here's why I said yes, here's why I volunteered.\n\nHelping at the CoderDojo was an easy enough decision. My kids take me anyway (note: *they* wanted to go; I didn't coerce them, I am a willing passenger here), and I am a big fan of the Curriculum Innovation Centre - to the point I am [sponsoring their upcoming film and animation festival through the studio](http://www.studioofthings.com/studio-sponsoring-bradford-schools-2015-film-and-animation-festival).\n\n[Paul Scott](https://twitter.com/Pederosa), who works at the centre for his day job, has use of the centre for the dojos on Saturdays. Paul himself volunteers his time at the dojos, not just to be a mentor but also take on the extra work of organising the dojos. He's a man who deserves support, the help.\n\nI like spending time with kids, especially when it comes to creating stuff. Teaching kids usually means you get schooled yourself - something that is incredibly rewarding and occasionally humbling. And the kids who come to the dojos are amazing. And, for me, another level is the parents, who are also well into what's going on.\n\n(I was one of those amazed parents at the weekend when [Shi](https://twitter.com/shi) and [Kriss](https://twitter.com/wetgenes) promised a session on pixel art and animated GIFs for their session! Shame I had my session to run!)\n\nIt all added up to an easy decision: I was more than happy to become a mentor.\n\nYoung Rewired State was a different case. I've [written before about my experience of March's event](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/getting-hyperlocal-with-young-people-in-leeds-2/).\n\nThere's a focus, a sense of purpose in trying to take young people's perspectives and use that to solve problems relevant to them: highly compelling. Again, a chance to mentor young people, to learn as much as I might teach them is incredibly satisfying. YRS's approach emphasises first steps of \"thinking about the why and the design of what you doing\" which taps into the way I approach work. I like that Young Rewired State advocates the use of open data in those solutions.\n\nSo, a step change, a side step from CoderDojo, but again a compelling one.\n\nThe Data Mill? I still struggle with my living-in-Bradford/working-in-Leeds but the Mill has great potential for not just the people of Leeds, but the wider area. As a data platform the Mill itself *seems* to have slowed down, stalled even as a widening platform over the past year. It needs, like Jonny Five, [more input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj-qBUWOYfE).\n\nAlso, can the Mill's data be utilised more by the wider public, not just the \"techies\"? That's one of the reasons I have run [Leeds Data School](http://www.studioofthings.com/leeds-data-school) for the Mill: to try to open up the minds of the public. Should the Mill just be about data storage? Can it go further?\n\nThe opportunity here is to understand and be involved with the Mill in a way that could enable... stuff - if it is possible. And alongside the strong and curious other members of the steering committee it's something that could garner some intriguing chats. So, again, a yes to the offer.\n\nBut I think that's my \"volunteer limit\" at the moment. And I see the need for experience, energy, and enthusiasm constantly. \n\nWhile I sceptically think the scale of volunteer-need *may be* more-widely prevalent by the advancement of the Conservatives' big society driven policies, there has always been the need and deployment of volunteers socially. I remember the Scouts in my youth. We visit National Trust locations. Both require and need volunteers to exist. Volunteering just exists at some scale.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can pay to this culture is my son's own experiences with CoderDojo. In one of the first sessions my son attended Paul Scott got the kids to log on to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). My kids see a lot of techie stuff all around, at home in their play, at home when they see some of the work I do, at school, on YouTube, etc etc.\n\nPaul managed to expose my son to something new - and Paul taught Nate enough of the basics in about 25 minutes that have set Nate up for so much of his spare time in the past month. (With the added lure of being able to 3D print his Tinkercad efforts.)\n\nI don't think I've actually been on that side of the fence before - someone else teaching my kid something I wanted a go on/with. I've always been on the other side, and usually not knowing how it affected the child and/or the parent. Nate learning something with me there was incredibly rewarding, not in anyway fuelled by my own inability to do anything decent in [3D Construction Kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Construction_Kit)!\n\nSo, why do I plaster those things everywhere, put my name against these things on places like LinkedIn and Twitter? It's not rampant egotism. These things I am involved with, I believe they should be supported, at least in attendance as participants and mentors. And I have a lot of \"followers\" on digital social media, which has its advantages. Put it out there, see who it draws. Last Saturday two people came to the CoderDojo because they'd seen me advertise it on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nI push the events so I can have moments like those, and a moment like this post. I am hoping one, maybe two people reading this will think \"I also want to get involved\" and/or \"I want my kid(s) to be involved\". That's why I do this sort of thing. Like I do with the [Leeds Digital Lunch](http://leedsdigitallunch.studioofthings.com/), like I did when I was involved with [Leeds Digital Festival](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/05/leeds-digital-britain). Getting people to get together, to inspire them to do stuff, maybe even stuff they've not really done before, is the best feeling.\n\n(As a side note I remember the chats about kicking off [Leeds Data Thing](http://www.leedsdatathing.co.uk/) when I was at Bloom, and it was, genuinely, a great idea along these lines but no-one was just finding the space and the time for it happen. So I headed out for a short walk to [the Cross Keys](http://www.the-crosskeys.com/), booked an evening, came back, told the guys, and off it rolled. Turning up to that first event with a sense of booked the space but not knowing what was happening was very exciting!)\n\nAt the mo there's a lot of the things happening in Leeds that ask for people's free time (or even time off, work or homelife) - the hacks, the workshops. There's an abundance of people who want to be involved with those and go. Those things seem well served. Those things don't need my time.\n\nBut the stuff aimed at the younger people? (And maybe even the elderly people?) Less well served. To me if there's already talent involved with that other stuff, I'll happily put any time I have for free into the more roots stuff, the \"kids stuff\".\n\nSo, here's an ask: If you can spare your Saturday morning - not even every month, but every few months - think about giving time up to use your experience and skills and pass them on, to inspire the kids with technology in a way most of us never had the chance to when we were younger. And if tech and design isn't your thing, look for something else. There's loads of chances out there!\n\nAnyone who tells you not to work with kids? They're wrong. It's one of the best things you can try. And if you read that and are still fearful of kids, find someone older you can inspire.\n\n* For more information on CoderDojo in Bradford, read blog posts on the Bradford Coder Dojo on the [Curriculum Innovation blog here](http://theblog.is/lac/category/bradford_coderdojo/).\n\n* For more information on Young Rewired State in Leeds, [speak to the team on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yrsleeds).","html":"<p>I updated <a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/siwilson\">my LinkedIn profile</a> this morning, to reflect some of the \"other stuff\" I've been involved in recently.</p>\n\n<p>It's all the recent volunteer stuff I give time up for for nowt: mentoring at the <a href=\"http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo\">Bradford CoderDojo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yrs.io/\">Young Rewired State</a> in Leeds, steering <a href=\"http://www.leedsdatamill.org/\">Leeds Data Mill</a> with the rest of the committee.</p>\n\n<p>Attending those commitments there's two half (weekend) days for the mentoring, the Mill takes out an evening.

So, again, a yes to the offer.</p>\n\n<p>But I think that's my \"volunteer limit\" at the moment. And I see the need for experience, energy, and enthusiasm constantly. </p>\n\n<p>While I sceptically think the scale of volunteer-need <em>may be</em> more-widely prevalent by the advancement of the Conservatives' big society driven policies, there has always been the need and deployment of volunteers socially. I remember the Scouts in my youth. We visit National Trust locations. Both require and need volunteers to exist. Volunteering just exists at some scale.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest compliment I can pay to this culture is my son's own experiences with CoderDojo. In one of the first sessions my son attended Paul Scott got the kids to log on to <a href=\"https://www.tinkercad.com/\">Tinkercad</a>. My kids see a lot of techie stuff all around, at home in their play, at home when they see some of the work I do, at school, on YouTube, etc etc.</p>\n\n<p>Paul managed to expose my son to something new - and Paul taught Nate enough of the basics in about 25 minutes that have set Nate up for so much of his spare time in the past month. (With the added lure of being able to 3D print his Tinkercad efforts.)</p>\n\n<p>I don't think I've actually been on that side of the fence before - someone else teaching my kid something I wanted a go on/with. I've always been on the other side, and usually not knowing how it affected the child and/or the parent. Nate learning something with me there was incredibly rewarding, not in anyway fuelled by my own inability to do anything decent in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Construction_Kit\">3D Construction Kit</a>!</p>\n\n<p>So, why do I plaster those things everywhere, put my name against these things on places like LinkedIn and Twitter? It's not rampant egotism. These things I am involved with, I believe they should be supported, at least in attendance as participants and mentors. And I have a lot of \"followers\" on digital social media, which has its advantages. Put it out there, see who it draws. Last Saturday two people came to the CoderDojo because they'd seen me advertise it on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>I push the events so I can have moments like those, and a moment like this post. I am hoping one, maybe two people reading this will think \"I also want to get involved\" and/or \"I want my kid(s) to be involved\". That's why I do this sort of thing. Like I do with the <a href=\"http://leedsdigitallunch.studioofthings.com/\">Leeds Digital Lunch</a>, like I did when I was involved with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/05/leeds-digital-britain\">Leeds Digital Festival</a>. Getting people to get together, to inspire them to do stuff, maybe even stuff they've not really done before, is the best feeling.</p>\n\n<p>(As a side note I remember the chats about kicking off <a href=\"http://www.leedsdatathing.co.uk/\">Leeds Data Thing</a> when I was at Bloom, and it was, genuinely, a great idea along these lines but no-one was just finding the space and the time for it happen. So I headed out for a short walk to <a href=\"http://www.the-crosskeys.com/\">the Cross Keys</a>, booked an evening, came back, told the guys, and off it rolled. Turning up to that first event with a sense of booked the space but not knowing what was happening was very exciting!)</p>\n\n<p>At the mo there's a lot of the things happening in Leeds that ask for people's free time (or even time off, work or homelife) - the hacks, the workshops. There's an abundance of people who want to be involved with those and go. Those things seem well served. Those things don't need my time.</p>\n\n<p>But the stuff aimed at the younger people? (And maybe even the elderly people?) Less well served. To me if there's already talent involved with that other stuff, I'll happily put any time I have for free into the more roots stuff, the \"kids stuff\".</p>\n\n<p>So, here's an ask: If you can spare your Saturday morning - not even every month, but every few months - think about giving time up to use your experience and skills and pass them on, to inspire the kids with technology in a way most of us never had the chance to when we were younger. And if tech and design isn't your thing, look for something else. There's loads of chances out there!</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who tells you not to work with kids? They're wrong. It's one of the best things you can try. And if you read that and are still fearful of kids, find someone older you can inspire.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For more information on CoderDojo in Bradford, read blog posts on the Bradford Coder Dojo on the <a href=\"http://theblog.is/lac/category/bradford_coderdojo/\">Curriculum Innovation blog here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>For more information on Young Rewired State in Leeds, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yrsleeds\">speak to the team on Twitter</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>","image":"/content/images/2015/04/me-and-nate.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-04-20T13:37:02.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-09-28T05:19:40.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-04-20T21:25:22.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":51,"uuid":"47d84b46-bb4c-4e56-bf1a-1aa27a1d1e52","title":"The future could be ace, but we still need to think of IE8","slug":"the-future-could-be-ace-but-we-still-need-to-think-of-ie8","markdown":"A few weeks back we were looking into a new project.\n\nThe old \"Do we have to support IE8?\" point came up.\n\nChat with the client.\n\nGlobally, IE accounts for just over half the \"desktop\" web traffic.

Reasons why I called the business \"a studio\" rather than \"an agency\", how the business could work, survive, and grow. All that stuff is in there. Some bits stand out more than others.\n\nAnyway something lingered away while going through it all.\n\n**Why was I doing \"my own thing\"?**\n\nTo explain: I was having a chat with someone recently who said it was inevitable I'd do my own thing. I get this a bit.\n\nThey (some people) say I have my own ideas. They say I do things differently from the norm. They say I don't just see the world as \"digital\" or \"traditional\". They say I see a lot more of \"the wider picture\". They say I can deliver a lot more of \"the wider picture\".  They say the things I do have positive results (and there’s been some negative ones to learn from as well). They say I way I do things doesn’t fit into “agencies”, at least the existing local ones. And it goes on. Some and all of these, they say, apparently lead to the inevitability of \"doing your own thing\".\n\n**I am not so sure me doing my own thing was inevitably something I'd choose.**\n\nI love the buzz of agency life, the buzz of a good agency. A good working environment is infectious - and \"good\" is about realism as much as it is about being creative with your ideas and application. There needs to be a rational element to it, the work has to... work. It's got to be balanced. It brings assurance and stability.\n\nI've been lucky to work with fun, talented people at some great places. I am accused of having Brahm at the forefront of my mind too much. I did spend a month shy of nine years there during my formative agency years, and felt lucky to work somewhere that stood for something, that gave a shit. Beyond there I've had a good mix during my career, each place full of talent, full of opportunities, most of it waiting to be untapped. \n\nIn the best of those we all worked together, were trusted and - for the most part - responsible, collaborating with a common understood purpose: At the end of the day the business end of that - we need as much money coming in as there is going out - was understood by all. The best agencies are run effectively by a talented collective who understand that. Like I say, that’s fun to be amongst, and exciting.\n\n**Rewind a year.**\n\nI left Home and felt like throwing the towel in. Head off to be a teacher (an increasing route out of agency world) or something else. I'd gone in to Home and just got on with it, thinking we could move the place to become, as I saw it, \"the BBH of the north\" (which definitely still seems increasingly brash as the days go by).\n\nDespite promising myself when I joined I wouldn't give everything, I did, in a massive effort to understand the place and then try to move it forward. By the sudden end I was spent. I don't regret joining Home though - it felt we all shared something like the same idea. You can't predict how things turn out.\n\n(As an aside, I keep a quiet ear open for what the Homies are doing since I left - and it seems to be going alllllrrrright.)\n\nBefore I joined Home, after I left Bloom two years back, I talked to a lot of bodies, very few who wanted to employ me. As time went on I looked at the idea of “my own thing” as something to pay the bills and was actually getting on doing it.\n\nI often don't see the point of starting from scratch. If there’s something that can be folded differently into better shape, why start afresh?\n\n**You're already some way along, at the Just Visiting corner of a Monopoly board.**\n\nIt's not being lazy - starting up takes time. I would always take hitting the ground running foremost. And I like I said, I genuinely enjoy that buzz of being around good people - and agencies come with the idea of strength in some sort of numbers. Irrespective of \"looking at solo stuff\", I thought I could employ my thinking at Home - so went there.\n\nWhen I left Home I remembered the struggles to find somewhere to hole up when I left Bloom.\n\n**\"Sell yourself to me - show me where you fit in\" was usually met with the reply \"We don't have that kind of role here, we don't see how you'd fit in.\"**\n\nWhen I took voluntary redundancy from Brahm in 2009 I'd worked myself into a career cul-de-sac then, of a different kind.\n\nBack then I deliberately tried to get myself into a mental place where I knew I had the skills, knowledge, and confidence in both of those, to get a job somewhere I fancied locally.\n\n**From years of rumbling along going with the flow at Brahm, I gave myself some focus, some tangible ambition.**\n\nI made a little list of places to aspire to be and worked my arse off to get to one of those (which I did: twentysix).\n\n12 months ago moving \"back down\" (like I did in 2009) wasn't going to happen again, that was clear. So, I felt I had no choice but to do my own thing, whatever that was.\n\nSome people talk about how they make their move, how they planned it, they saved up, then resigned. Others - many it seems after the recent Leeds Digital Lunch - are pushed by redundancy and don't look back.\n\nI was probably in that latter line of thinking, pushed into my own thing through being in a position where I couldn't get another job in the Leeds area. Being unemployable spurs you into action.\n\nSo I got on with it.\n\n**\"Take the positives.\"**\n\nI saw it as a chance to work the way I felt it should be done:\n\n* Reason led work, knowing why we are doing what are doing.\n\n* Not against one process, but about being adaptable and curious based on the work's needs.\n\n* Work with the people I want to, to actually be doing work, not managing people and processes.\n\n* ..and therefore having the chance to say no.\n\n* A chance to work with all sorts of bodies, a real variety - and learn what is being done well out there and what isn’t.\n\n* I could work on \"it\" a day, a week, or longer - on site, from home, from a coffee shop, wherever was needed.\n\n* Being open to try a few things - a bit of grunt work to go with the \"thinking work\".\n\nEarly on I relied on pushing a lot of work out to extra help, so Mike came to work alongside me doing strategy, design, and delivery, and “I” became a “We” — and we got a serviced office to work from for 12 months. It’s been good. He’s been a solid partner in everything. I would have gone spare alone!\n\nAnd by being a \"studio\" there has been the chances to do work with \"agencies\" and \"directly with clients\". It's as close to having my cake and eating it as I could have.\n\nAt the middle of it all is doing the work. People come to me, we have chats, talk about how we could work together. We decide then some we do work with, some we don’t. (Sometimes we have a trial workshop to try out the way we work.) As a business we say \"yes\" and we say \"no\" and understand between us why. If we say \"no\", we try to refer the job on.\n\nI have been asked about a strategy for the studio's growth or an exit strategy (because that's what we all need these days, so say readers of [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/)).\n\nI am candid to admit at the moment I have no idea where the studio will be in six months, let alone 12 months. I have an idea of three months from now, and the next month in more detail, and especially the next week. As long as we break even every three months, and for the first financial year, and enjoy it. We have no investment funding and the bank never offers any support. What else can we do as a small business? See where the work takes us.\n\n**I've been through it all now and know that what I plan today won’t be the case tomorrow.**\n\nI've learnt that at bigger businesses and smaller businesses. \n\nI've had bodies ask if we could work \"closer\", either through exclusivity or potentially being absorbed. I've always been open to the idea of working closer, whatever that entails.\n\nI see the identity of the studio as disposable, which some see as a surprise. \"It's your thing,\" apparently. But I've also been quite accepting that I am running the studio because I can't be anywhere else - but I also want to make sure if we were to work \"closer\" it would be with like-minded people. If a body came to us that was aligned, we'd talk. The name over the business isn't such a precious thing for me.  But at the moment we don't have an attractive offer, so there's nothing there.\n\nBut personally I don't just want to be doing \"just digital stuff\", for me a marginalising approach. I want to be plugged into an environment that allows strategies to deploy things in the appropriate place, not because \"the digital department has a P and L line to meet so we have to do a website\". Also digital isn't just about websites. And digital is as much a part of real lives as any other medium. A chance to do that is part of my jigsaw.\n\nSo, to go back to where we started: **I am not so sure me *choosing* to do my own thing was inevitable.**\n\nIt’s not something I have *chosen*. But it is where I am now - and I can't complain. In the past year we've worked on the whole spectrum of projects, from simply building some emails for an agency against their supplied designs through to fully designing and building websites, and then working on innovation projects and digital strategies for some big organisations.\n\nWe've even taken time out to run some \"classes\", such as [Shrink Your Briefs](http://www.studioofthings.com/shrink-your-briefs) (pictured at the top of this article). There's certainly variety.\n\n**Where does our future lie?**\n\nWe don't do as much work in Leeds and the local area as much as I thought we initially would, but c'est la vie, I and we go where the work is. \n\nMaybe the studio will grow to be something bigger. Maybe we'll get a big break we choose to take.\n\nBut at the moment, we don't have that, and it's going alright. There's now four of us in the studio, we're doing good work, we enjoy the work, we work with some really good clients (and I say that genuinely), we're doing it our way, and we're living in the moment.","html":"<p>With running “my own business” now just about hitting the one year mark, I've been looking over the stuff I put down a year back and since.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pictured: The Shrink Your Briefs class at <a href=\"http://www.studioofthings.com/\">Studio of Things</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>I've a collection of documents - business plans, road maps, and all that; and I also write a “behind closed doors” blog that helps me get my thoughts down and worked through - I've reviewed to see how it’s gone.

Irrespective of \"looking at solo stuff\", I thought I could employ my thinking at Home - so went there.</p>\n\n<p>When I left Home I remembered the struggles to find somewhere to hole up when I left Bloom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Sell yourself to me - show me where you fit in\" was usually met with the reply \"We don't have that kind of role here, we don't see how you'd fit in.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I took voluntary redundancy from Brahm in 2009 I'd worked myself into a career cul-de-sac then, of a different kind.</p>\n\n<p>Back then I deliberately tried to get myself into a mental place where I knew I had the skills, knowledge, and confidence in both of those, to get a job somewhere I fancied locally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From years of rumbling along going with the flow at Brahm, I gave myself some focus, some tangible ambition.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I made a little list of places to aspire to be and worked my arse off to get to one of those (which I did: twentysix).</p>\n\n<p>12 months ago moving \"back down\" (like I did in 2009) wasn't going to happen again, that was clear. So, I felt I had no choice but to do my own thing, whatever that was.</p>\n\n<p>Some people talk about how they make their move, how they planned it, they saved up, then resigned. Others - many it seems after the recent Leeds Digital Lunch - are pushed by redundancy and don't look back.</p>\n\n<p>I was probably in that latter line of thinking, pushed into my own thing through being in a position where I couldn't get another job in the Leeds area. Being unemployable spurs you into action.</p>\n\n<p>So I got on with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Take the positives.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>I saw it as a chance to work the way I felt it should be done:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Reason led work, knowing why we are doing what are doing.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not against one process, but about being adaptable and curious based on the work's needs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Work with the people I want to, to actually be doing work, not managing people and processes.</p></li>\n<li><p>..and therefore having the chance to say no.</p></li>\n<li><p>A chance to work with all sorts of bodies, a real variety - and learn what is being done well out there and what isn’t.</p></li>\n<li><p>I could work on \"it\" a day, a week, or longer - on site, from home, from a coffee shop, wherever was needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Being open to try a few things - a bit of grunt work to go with the \"thinking work\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Early on I relied on pushing a lot of work out to extra help, so Mike came to work alongside me doing strategy, design, and delivery, and “I” became a “We” — and we got a serviced office to work from for 12 months. It’s been good. He’s been a solid partner in everything. I would have gone spare alone!</p>\n\n<p>And by being a \"studio\" there has been the chances to do work with \"agencies\" and \"directly with clients\". It's as close to having my cake and eating it as I could have.</p>\n\n<p>At the middle of it all is doing the work. People come to me, we have chats, talk about how we could work together. We decide then some we do work with, some we don’t. (Sometimes we have a trial workshop to try out the way we work.) As a business we say \"yes\" and we say \"no\" and understand between us why. If we say \"no\", we try to refer the job on.</p>\n\n<p>I have been asked about a strategy for the studio's growth or an exit strategy (because that's what we all need these days, so say readers of <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/\">Fast Company</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I am candid to admit at the moment I have no idea where the studio will be in six months, let alone 12 months. I have an idea of three months from now, and the next month in more detail, and especially the next week. As long as we break even every three months, and for the first financial year, and enjoy it. We have no investment funding and the bank never offers any support. What else can we do as a small business? See where the work takes us.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I've been through it all now and know that what I plan today won’t be the case tomorrow.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've learnt that at bigger businesses and smaller businesses. </p>\n\n<p>I've had bodies ask if we could work \"closer\", either through exclusivity or potentially being absorbed. I've always been open to the idea of working closer, whatever that entails.</p>\n\n<p>I see the identity of the studio as disposable, which some see as a surprise. \"It's your thing,\" apparently. But I've also been quite accepting that I am running the studio because I can't be anywhere else - but I also want to make sure if we were to work \"closer\" it would be with like-minded people. If a body came to us that was aligned, we'd talk. The name over the business isn't such a precious thing for me.  But at the moment we don't have an attractive offer, so there's nothing there.</p>\n\n<p>But personally I don't just want to be doing \"just digital stuff\", for me a marginalising approach. I want to be plugged into an environment that allows strategies to deploy things in the appropriate place, not because \"the digital department has a P and L line to meet so we have to do a website\". Also digital isn't just about websites. And digital is as much a part of real lives as any other medium. A chance to do that is part of my jigsaw.</p>\n\n<p>So, to go back to where we started: <strong>I am not so sure me <em>choosing</em> to do my own thing was inevitable.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s not something I have <em>chosen</em>. But it is where I am now - and I can't complain. In the past year we've worked on the whole spectrum of projects, from simply building some emails for an agency against their supplied designs through to fully designing and building websites, and then working on innovation projects and digital strategies for some big organisations.</p>\n\n<p>We've even taken time out to run some \"classes\", such as <a href=\"http://www.studioofthings.com/shrink-your-briefs\">Shrink Your Briefs</a> (pictured at the top of this article). There's certainly variety.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where does our future lie?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We don't do as much work in Leeds and the local area as much as I thought we initially would, but c'est la vie, I and we go where the work is. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe the studio will grow to be something bigger. Maybe we'll get a big break we choose to take.</p>\n\n<p>But at the moment, we don't have that, and it's going alright. There's now four of us in the studio, we're doing good work, we enjoy the work, we work with some really good clients (and I say that genuinely), we're doing it our way, and we're living in the moment.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/05/brief-class.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-05-11T10:39:11.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-05-14T04:20:48.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-05-09T08:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":53,"uuid":"d77c6c90-03ca-463a-a7d1-5acd3fd73539","title":"Pitches: I love to hate you (but love a good workshop)","slug":"pitches-i-love-to-hate-you","markdown":"Ask anyone in an agency their views on pitches, and it's the thing everyone loves to hate - and hates to love.\n\nAt the worst end they are viewed as a gamble, a drain on resources, the cause of much in-fighting (“We've only got three days to do the creative because planning have sat on it for a fortnight!”), and a potential confidence killer.\n\nOn the best side, pitches bring out people’s raw talents, are great times to be part of a team working together, and winning pitches is a huge confidence boost.\n\nThe bigger shame for me, for the most part pitches miss out possibly the most fun bit: working with another body, actually understanding what the “agency” and the “client” will be like working together.

You can catch the slides at the [bottom of this post](#slides). The summary of the whole thing was [captured by Claire Gibbons in her photo above](https://twitter.com/PlanetClaire/status/603983558408011777).\n\nA couple of people have dropped me a line to ask why I didn’t cover in detail everything that was on the initial “spec” for the session (which you can see on the [NUX website](http://nuxuk.org/2015/05/08/nux-leeds-28-may-2015-the-shared-creation-experience/)).\n\nWhile I tried to touch on everything, a lot of originally planned detail didn’t make the cut, and some of the stuff that was dropped I felt was vital nitty gritty, at least against the original spec.\n\nA quick brain dump on just that. I apologise in advance if the flow and rhythm of this is a bit all over the place. Think of it as freeform jazz.\n\nWhen the NUX team dropped me a line a month back about talking at the next event I had already been toying with creating a brand new session around misuse of “brand” or misuse of “prototype”, but, y’know, audience.\n\nI already had a talk that was fleshed out - around “collaboration”, the concepts, the definitions, and also the misuse. Collaboration is a buzzword at the moment — but it's still had a traditional definition, *collaboration* a key component for a team. It's all around a team that functions well. (Not unlike love, and a bit like the Force in Star Wars. And I am sure there are plenty of other movie references.)\n\nThe existing talk on collaboration I had previously used in a half day workshop a few months before. I'd used it  as a session opener and an eye opener, and had some learnings to feed back in to revising the talk.\n\nOne of the best things about my current role is I dip into all sorts of places, some for a day, some for longer, some just to help out, others to be a project member over a longer period. By going everywhere I get to see a variety of approaches, some working, some not working. On top of that is all the stuff I had done previously in my career. With my experiences over my career there could be some fun to be had talking about collaboration in a UX centric session.\n\nDespite the UX focus I wanted to make sure I could deliver something that just about anyone could get into - I didn’t presume that everyone at the session would be a hardcore UXer.\n\nIn the first week of May I was working on cutting the session down, shaping it (mainly in my mind with the odd page of paper).\n\nI was getting some notes via email, Twitter, and LinkedIn off the back of the NUX team [publicising the talk](http://nuxuk.org/2015/05/08/nux-leeds-28-may-2015-the-shared-creation-experience/). This helped to get some focus, show where to cut stuff out and distil the previous workshop session I’d done. The “What I learnt from ‘traditional agency’ way” seemed to raise some interested eyebrows. (I’d had some similar feedback on [my Forefront talk back in November](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/).) I thought it was a good chance to \"reveal\" and draw upon the six years I spent in the design and advertising bit of a big agency in Leeds (Brahm). (As sad fact not so widely known, as my slide said.)\n\nWith a bit of an audience led steer I took my existing talk on collab and rated slides on a scale of 1 to 5: 1 being essential, 5 meaning dumped. I worked with what was 3 and above, and then tried to knit a story together around it. I found even by doing this I was working on something that more in the region of 90 minutes. I'd lost a quarter of the talk, but not enough to make it focused enough to fit into an NUX session. So I started to look at threads, and reevaluated the content.\n\nFraming “collaboration” in the context of my experiences working in and with organisations that see themselves as - or are seen as - “traditional” and “digital” seemed crude, but a good starter for ten.\n\nEarly on the idea of “clients” and “agencies” as a focus rose, to make the session easier for the audience to get into. Again I couldn't presume everyone would get this, but it provided a simple focus. To be sure I checked right at the start of my NUX session if everyone got what \"clients\" and \"agencies\" were — and apologised for this lazy banding. But it helped get across the idea of a body with *a need* and a body that *could provide a needed service* - and then look at how they work together. It saved time.\n\nBut still I was casting stuff aside. I found early on I was jettisoning some of the stuff *I* found really interesting.\n\nThe role of research and planning in the “creative process” seemed a killer area to explore for me. In “traditional” agencies the planning department writing the brief and the crossover period with the creative department (for the most part) isn’t that massive. But the point there is a thought through, usually research brief seemed my summary point. I kept that in, even if ditching the detail. \n\nCompare that with the amount of research a number of digital user experience *designers* are involved in. I recognised though that this was a good session in its own right, especially when I folded in the idea of bringing “creative” into wireframes (example: I like to placing imagery styles in wireframes when I feel it will provide an enlightening response). So while I lost a good chunk of detail, I at least touched upon it - and have put the cuttings to one side for another talk, another day.\n\nI made sure I kept in the flow what happened on ad accounts. Starting off as a digital person and then switching to \"non-digital\" I found this awesome. We created ads, got them out there, analysed the response, and then responded based on that response, either with iterations on those ads or starting again, over and over again. It’s [the lean loop](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), yo!\n\nLeaning back on the way \"planning\" contributed to the work, I also folded in something a friend had raised recently: How does the designer know they are doing “good” research? Does a UX designer doing research know how to “test the test”? How do you know? I planted the seed for that with an anecdote about a flawed piece of research that was the basis for quite a big project I was brought in to evaluate.\n\nAlso sharing your thoughts with a “wing man” is a small thing I wasn’t seeing much of in UX arms of agencies. In the ad department we had at Brahm there was frequent “shows” with the rest of the team, exploring ideas, taking on board feedback to improve - or enhance justification.\n\nIt seemed too obvious to bring in the debate the crossover between UX and UI, coder and designer, search marketeer and UX designer and so on. That happens elsewhere and regularly. (Although is fascinating - but again this stuff was cut.)\n\nWhile roles and the people who carry them out are key tenets of collaboration, by concentrating on the detail around these roles muddled the session. A shame as I really wanted to spend that time looking at the traditional agency roles of “planner” and “designer” and see how they compared to a “UX designer”. But again, cut and stored.\n\nI found myself circling the clash of \"traditional\" and \"digital\", the seeming ignorance, the one-man-upmanship, and wanted to geter across “Does traditional and digital matter? Can we just forget all that and concentrate on creating user experiences wherever they manifest?” UX is a phrase \"owned\" by usually digital designers. \"Traditional agency\" briefs put such a focus on capturing an audience and understanding the audience's response - and what we have to do to understand how we can can make this happen.\n\nTo contrast with that, I’ve been a participant in some user experience sessions recently where the facilitator just didn’t take into account the people in the session, how to connect with them. I felt like an outsider. After one of the sessions, a facilitator told me “this is the way we do sessions”. No room for maneuver.\n\nI got into a chat with a fellow experience designer and we shared separate similar experiences, being in someone else’s session and it just not clicking. It seemed to go against the grain of collaboration between the facilitator, the people in the room, and the knowledge/insight he must have been seeking. It struck me as framing the process(es) we go through as a service and we have to think more about how we get the right responses ourselves, examining the *user experience of user experience design*.\n\nI had to throw in [George Gallop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gallup). I like to chuck in one of “my heroes”. Usually they come from way, way back and I get pulled up for this, “Why does it matter?” and all that. I think that in the 1930s they were doing research, studying effectiveness of work on audiences, using AB testing, without computers is a point unto itself. It strips away the “digital” and emphasising your methods and having the time to feed your learnings back in. It also dispels the notion thrown about that this sort of thing is a “digital thing”.\n\nThere’s [a great interview with Joe Stewart](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/interview-joe-stewart-612328) (now co-running Work & Co., previously at Huge) where he talks about how he didn’t *train to be a designer*, he learnt to be a designer, and he made up for that lack of perceived “formal design education” by using his own time to study, to learn.\n\nIt’s not a new thing, but it is increasingly rare to find people who work in design, communication, whatever you want to call it, that know stuff like who Gallop is, let alone studied to work their way into \"the industry\".\n\nSure, we are not beholden to the past, but the past has shaped where we are. It’s worth spending a night just digging in and seeing where some reading up on this takes you. Many of us didn’t study this sort of stuff in our days jobs at school. And while we’re always reading, saving stuff away in Pocket and Evernote about progressions, there’s still some learning we can look back at, some theories, some characters.\n\nThe shift in relationship between client/agency created chances for us as experiences designers to put the focus on the reasoning and the design construct.\n\nMy point was that increasingly agencies are brought in for the “first half”, bringing external perspective to research, create a strategy, and work on the design nailed before the client takes over to deliver with their internal dev teams (in my lazy scenario). It’s an increasing shift that creates intrigue around the perceptions of the “traditional” client/agency dynamic. It’s a fascinating change, how the agency stays involved, ensures that quality is assured in this different level of collaboration.\n\nWhile I littered references to the lean loop throughout my hour, “do school reports on your work” also seems a fun way to end, especially after I’ve asked you think about working like being in a school class. I’ve worked in plenty of places where there is the intention of folding learnings from how we worked (ie. not the actual output that users/audiences/consumers see, but the actual methods we go through to achieve that work) back into working practices in a “lean” way, so we’re constantly learning, constantly improving the way we work.\n\nBut in most of those places there is intention only.

You can catch the slides at the <a href=\"#slides\">bottom of this post</a>. The summary of the whole thing was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlanetClaire/status/603983558408011777\">captured by Claire Gibbons in her photo above</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of people have dropped me a line to ask why I didn’t cover in detail everything that was on the initial “spec” for the session (which you can see on the <a href=\"http://nuxuk.org/2015/05/08/nux-leeds-28-may-2015-the-shared-creation-experience/\">NUX website</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While I tried to touch on everything, a lot of originally planned detail didn’t make the cut, and some of the stuff that was dropped I felt was vital nitty gritty, at least against the original spec.</p>\n\n<p>A quick brain dump on just that. I apologise in advance if the flow and rhythm of this is a bit all over the place. Think of it as freeform jazz.</p>\n\n<p>When the NUX team dropped me a line a month back about talking at the next event I had already been toying with creating a brand new session around misuse of “brand” or misuse of “prototype”, but, y’know, audience.</p>\n\n<p>I already had a talk that was fleshed out - around “collaboration”, the concepts, the definitions, and also the misuse. Collaboration is a buzzword at the moment — but it's still had a traditional definition, <em>collaboration</em> a key component for a team. It's all around a team that functions well. (Not unlike love, and a bit like the Force in Star Wars. And I am sure there are plenty of other movie references.)</p>\n\n<p>The existing talk on collaboration I had previously used in a half day workshop a few months before. I'd used it  as a session opener and an eye opener, and had some learnings to feed back in to revising the talk.</p>\n\n<p>One of the best things about my current role is I dip into all sorts of places, some for a day, some for longer, some just to help out, others to be a project member over a longer period. By going everywhere I get to see a variety of approaches, some working, some not working. On top of that is all the stuff I had done previously in my career. With my experiences over my career there could be some fun to be had talking about collaboration in a UX centric session.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the UX focus I wanted to make sure I could deliver something that just about anyone could get into - I didn’t presume that everyone at the session would be a hardcore UXer.</p>\n\n<p>In the first week of May I was working on cutting the session down, shaping it (mainly in my mind with the odd page of paper).</p>\n\n<p>I was getting some notes via email, Twitter, and LinkedIn off the back of the NUX team <a href=\"http://nuxuk.org/2015/05/08/nux-leeds-28-may-2015-the-shared-creation-experience/\">publicising the talk</a>. This helped to get some focus, show where to cut stuff out and distil the previous workshop session I’d done. The “What I learnt from ‘traditional agency’ way” seemed to raise some interested eyebrows. (I’d had some similar feedback on <a href=\"http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/\">my Forefront talk back in November</a>.) I thought it was a good chance to \"reveal\" and draw upon the six years I spent in the design and advertising bit of a big agency in Leeds (Brahm). (As sad fact not so widely known, as my slide said.)</p>\n\n<p>With a bit of an audience led steer I took my existing talk on collab and rated slides on a scale of 1 to 5: 1 being essential, 5 meaning dumped. I worked with what was 3 and above, and then tried to knit a story together around it. I found even by doing this I was working on something that more in the region of 90 minutes. I'd lost a quarter of the talk, but not enough to make it focused enough to fit into an NUX session. So I started to look at threads, and reevaluated the content.</p>\n\n<p>Framing “collaboration” in the context of my experiences working in and with organisations that see themselves as - or are seen as - “traditional” and “digital” seemed crude, but a good starter for ten.</p>\n\n<p>Early on the idea of “clients” and “agencies” as a focus rose, to make the session easier for the audience to get into. Again I couldn't presume everyone would get this, but it provided a simple focus. To be sure I checked right at the start of my NUX session if everyone got what \"clients\" and \"agencies\" were — and apologised for this lazy banding. But it helped get across the idea of a body with <em>a need</em> and a body that <em>could provide a needed service</em> - and then look at how they work together. It saved time.</p>\n\n<p>But still I was casting stuff aside. I found early on I was jettisoning some of the stuff <em>I</em> found really interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The role of research and planning in the “creative process” seemed a killer area to explore for me. In “traditional” agencies the planning department writing the brief and the crossover period with the creative department (for the most part) isn’t that massive. But the point there is a thought through, usually research brief seemed my summary point. I kept that in, even if ditching the detail. </p>\n\n<p>Compare that with the amount of research a number of digital user experience <em>designers</em> are involved in. I recognised though that this was a good session in its own right, especially when I folded in the idea of bringing “creative” into wireframes (example: I like to placing imagery styles in wireframes when I feel it will provide an enlightening response). So while I lost a good chunk of detail, I at least touched upon it - and have put the cuttings to one side for another talk, another day.</p>\n\n<p>I made sure I kept in the flow what happened on ad accounts. Starting off as a digital person and then switching to \"non-digital\" I found this awesome. We created ads, got them out there, analysed the response, and then responded based on that response, either with iterations on those ads or starting again, over and over again. It’s <a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/principles\">the lean loop</a>, yo!</p>\n\n<p>Leaning back on the way \"planning\" contributed to the work, I also folded in something a friend had raised recently: How does the designer know they are doing “good” research? Does a UX designer doing research know how to “test the test”? How do you know? I planted the seed for that with an anecdote about a flawed piece of research that was the basis for quite a big project I was brought in to evaluate.</p>\n\n<p>Also sharing your thoughts with a “wing man” is a small thing I wasn’t seeing much of in UX arms of agencies. In the ad department we had at Brahm there was frequent “shows” with the rest of the team, exploring ideas, taking on board feedback to improve - or enhance justification.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed too obvious to bring in the debate the crossover between UX and UI, coder and designer, search marketeer and UX designer and so on. That happens elsewhere and regularly. (Although is fascinating - but again this stuff was cut.)</p>\n\n<p>While roles and the people who carry them out are key tenets of collaboration, by concentrating on the detail around these roles muddled the session. A shame as I really wanted to spend that time looking at the traditional agency roles of “planner” and “designer” and see how they compared to a “UX designer”. But again, cut and stored.</p>\n\n<p>I found myself circling the clash of \"traditional\" and \"digital\", the seeming ignorance, the one-man-upmanship, and wanted to geter across “Does traditional and digital matter? Can we just forget all that and concentrate on creating user experiences wherever they manifest?” UX is a phrase \"owned\" by usually digital designers. \"Traditional agency\" briefs put such a focus on capturing an audience and understanding the audience's response - and what we have to do to understand how we can can make this happen.</p>\n\n<p>To contrast with that, I’ve been a participant in some user experience sessions recently where the facilitator just didn’t take into account the people in the session, how to connect with them. I felt like an outsider. After one of the sessions, a facilitator told me “this is the way we do sessions”. No room for maneuver.</p>\n\n<p>I got into a chat with a fellow experience designer and we shared separate similar experiences, being in someone else’s session and it just not clicking. It seemed to go against the grain of collaboration between the facilitator, the people in the room, and the knowledge/insight he must have been seeking. It struck me as framing the process(es) we go through as a service and we have to think more about how we get the right responses ourselves, examining the <em>user experience of user experience design</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I had to throw in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gallup\">George Gallop</a>. I like to chuck in one of “my heroes”. Usually they come from way, way back and I get pulled up for this, “Why does it matter?” and all that. I think that in the 1930s they were doing research, studying effectiveness of work on audiences, using AB testing, without computers is a point unto itself. It strips away the “digital” and emphasising your methods and having the time to feed your learnings back in. It also dispels the notion thrown about that this sort of thing is a “digital thing”.</p>\n\n<p>There’s <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/design/interview-joe-stewart-612328\">a great interview with Joe Stewart</a> (now co-running Work &amp; Co., previously at Huge) where he talks about how he didn’t <em>train to be a designer</em>, he learnt to be a designer, and he made up for that lack of perceived “formal design education” by using his own time to study, to learn.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not a new thing, but it is increasingly rare to find people who work in design, communication, whatever you want to call it, that know stuff like who Gallop is, let alone studied to work their way into \"the industry\".</p>\n\n<p>Sure, we are not beholden to the past, but the past has shaped where we are. It’s worth spending a night just digging in and seeing where some reading up on this takes you. Many of us didn’t study this sort of stuff in our days jobs at school. And while we’re always reading, saving stuff away in Pocket and Evernote about progressions, there’s still some learning we can look back at, some theories, some characters.</p>\n\n<p>The shift in relationship between client/agency created chances for us as experiences designers to put the focus on the reasoning and the design construct.</p>\n\n<p>My point was that increasingly agencies are brought in for the “first half”, bringing external perspective to research, create a strategy, and work on the design nailed before the client takes over to deliver with their internal dev teams (in my lazy scenario). It’s an increasing shift that creates intrigue around the perceptions of the “traditional” client/agency dynamic. It’s a fascinating change, how the agency stays involved, ensures that quality is assured in this different level of collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>While I littered references to the lean loop throughout my hour, “do school reports on your work” also seems a fun way to end, especially after I’ve asked you think about working like being in a school class. I’ve worked in plenty of places where there is the intention of folding learnings from how we worked (ie. not the actual output that users/audiences/consumers see, but the actual methods we go through to achieve that work) back into working practices in a “lean” way, so we’re constantly learning, constantly improving the way we work.</p>\n\n<p>But in most of those places there is intention only. There is rarely value on taking some time out to formally openly share these thoughts, to recognise flaw, improvements, and what is done right. As participants and contributors to the design and creation process “improvement” of the way we work is everyone’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>Think about this: How would you feel if you or your child didn't get an end of term school report?</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"slides\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The thought that’s part of the user experience of creating a user experience and a UX designer could lead that review and report back in (rather than, say, a project manager or producer) just tickled me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who came along to the session - and thanks to the NUX team for inviting.

Some takeaway thoughts.\n\nIt is worth disclosing up front I attended the event voluntarily in every sense. I was made aware of it by someone who thought I’d find it interesting. I wasn’t paid to attend. I gave up a day of work. As I effectively work for myself I gave a day’s work in every sense. I’m totally cool with all of that. There’s no agenda here.\n\nWhat attracted me: The idea of the event, bringing together Leeds residents, service providers, and “technologists” for some sort of symposium. Excellent. The unconference format was a neat choice to explore together. And being promoted and driven by public services gave it some positive credence, and reach I'd hope.\n\nThere was an impressive turnout, in terms of numbers. It’s always gratifying to see healthy support in numbers. The balance of the participants on the day didn't feel right though. It was great to see an event where “older” people were attendance - and framed as the possible benefactors of this all day session. But for the main it felt like the older people were in the minority, amongst people from various public sector departments with a sprinkling of designer/technologists (like myself). The mix felt good, the quantities of the ingredients not so.\n\nWas the way the event was “promoted”, using Eventbrite to \"register\", using language like “rich tradition” to describe it, barriers?\n\nIn the pre-start coffee and mingle there was an nervousness in the room, an uncertainty to what was going to happen, what people were going to contribute, how. And not just from the “older people”.\n\nThe way the event started didn’t help. Setting up the day should be so people shouldn’t be afraid, they should be really clear on structure. A brief intro using the word acronyms, jargon, and “unconference” - what does that all actually mean to people in attendance?  The language of the intro didn’t play to the audience. Being open is hard for a lot of people. Sharing is hard. Especially in an unfamiliar format, flying in the face of the commonly accepted definition of “tradition”. Could there have been something at the beginning to help foster this?\n\nMick Ward followed that intro with a little talk that was neat and excellent. It described the state of play out there in the world. It was a great scene setter for the wider picture. As a piece of talking it resonated, highly relational. Dylan Roberts added in his take as \"the councils's CIO\" (\"What is a 'CIO'?\").\n\nThen the audience were asked for things of interest to shape the day. Some interesting topics/focuses for the sessions were mooted. Could this have been even more precise, raised some more precise issues, and afforded the opportunity for some really tight discussion?\n\nThroughout the day I spoke to the older people in attendance about how they were getting on. Several said they wished they’d had a think before the day, and knowing how the day would be formed would have made them do that - they may have had an idea, they came up with an idea on the spot that morning — but saying it out loud? They wanted to make sure they had worked that through so they said it “right”, \"writing it down\". Of course limited feedback from the attendees there, but a worthwhile consideration.\n\nThere were some great moments in the sessions.\n\nIn the first session I attended there was some interesting talk of the concept of “getting older” versus “getting old” versus “being old”. Dignity. Who knows “best”? Just because you are “old” doesn’t mean you are dysfunctional.\n\nLater on was a great discussion about capability - and even why a person should be dismissive of “digital takeover”. Dignity was a great theme, not dismissing just because someone was \"old\" they couldn't. Great example: \"I have a bus pass because I have passed the age I get one. But I have a car. I can still drive. I am capable of driving. I enjoy driving.\"\n\nThere were some fascinating chats about how digital could enhance, through speed, convenience, but in relevant circumstances.\n\nMatt Edgar’s offer to do a “walk, look around, and talk”: a great idea, making you look around, and could’ve been better attended. Could it have actually been a good “intro” to get people thinking about looking around as well as inside themselves?\n\nThe balance of the discussion in the sessions wavered, through a lack of light governance and structure. A number slipped well off-topic, something a designated “facilitator” (less a chairperson, more someone who just keeps the conversation on track) in each session would have helped. (Aside: several people said they “stepped up” to be ‘unofficial’ facilitators but more through necessity.) One session, devoid of any “Leeds residents” felt like it was “the staff” grilling “their bosses”. When there were “Leeds residents” the groups should have made sure they could share, even if inviting them to contribute with questions.\n\nOn several occasions the session ended with the oldest person/people having left with suggestions along the line “No wonder no-one is listening to them [older people]”. The point of the session: Everyone has a view to be heard, and we should have been accepting not dismissing. When people share there should be an expectancy that they will be sharing a very personal opinion. It matters to *them*. This again seemed to have been a “rule” laid down: listen, take away, don’t put down.  A priming to listen to everyone should have been clear.\n\nTo balance that I heard someone with a council lanyard say how “great it was to be able to talk to people we work for in this kind of forum - it’s why I have stayed in the council”. Top marks to the chap with a Libraries lanyard as well who really wanted to *understand*. And I know there were others.\n\n(If this sounds like I am being dismissive about the strong turnout from public service providers I am not. That was excellent. Just there needed to be an agreed capacity to listen rather than gesticulate.)\n\nAt the day’s end, the team running the event drew upon the audience to share their key points. With the number of sessions (four rooms, four times, so something like 16 possible sessions) it didn’t feel the variety of those sessions was represented in the summary sheet — especially given nearly half the attendees had already gone. Could a “facilitator” for each session have provided a couple of points as an initial bedrock for the end of day summary?\n\nI attended the day mindful of “Our goal is to understand the small steps we need to take in order to address the big issues!” I wouldn’t expect to go and leave with a big leap, but with the outcomes the value of the sharing seems debatable. With such a small number of“residents” to input on the day how valuable was the input? As a thought, what if this sort of event was held somewhere where there’s a critical mass of “residents” in the first place? As Trude, in her eighties, in the very first session said to me: “I am lucky to be here. I can make it. There are other how cannot. But they can still think and talk.”\n\nIf I had to summarise, Age Camp *was* enlightening and had the potential given the facilities, support, those gathered to bring some real insight, and the (apologies for the jargon) unconference format. I am sure there was *something* gleaned. At the least the value of listening to service users, current or potential?\n\nFor me? Not enough “service users” to listen to, not enough structure to ensure there was listening. In the usually inviting unconference structure it felt a missed opportunity. But that was my experience. I hope if you attended you didn’t feel the same, and you felt it will help make some steps forward. That Leeds is willing to try this way of doing things is a step forward itself.","html":"<p>The Monday just gone I attended <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/age-camp-leeds-tickets-16483162583\">Age Camp in Leeds</a>.

That Leeds is willing to try this way of doing things is a step forward itself.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/06/IMG_20150601_120446.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-06-03T12:17:58.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-06-04T08:13:54.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-06-03T12:24:25.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":59,"uuid":"d034e97d-cd48-42ac-9412-8d145ff72ae5","title":"Looking ahead to Leeds GovJam 2015","slug":"looking-ahead-to-leeds-govjam-2015","markdown":"As I type this the 2015 [Leeds GovJam](https://leedsgovjam.wordpress.com/) is about to kick off. A quick note.\n\nLet’s jump back a couple of weeks. [I talked at NUX in Leeds](/may-nux-leeds-notes/), a talk that covered a lot of bases.\n\nThe crux though was how, in 2003, I actually enjoyed my switch from digital (well, *web*) to a good six years focused on (non-digital) *design and ads*.\n\nIn short, that time I loved: A problem/brief would surface Monday morning and a new ad concept could in the printed press on Friday. That quick turnaround was such a kick!\n\nIn “that world” there was a nimbleness to the design and ad work that I felt was missing from the digital stuff I’d worked in. There was a looser way of exploring ideas that wasn’t just about loads of computer finished visuals. There was a focus on the idea, and the content.\n\nWe used our minds, our creativity, paper, pens, more paper, rationalisation, even more paper, and a (usually) quick bit of Mac work to work through the problems, our ideas, and what “worked” before despatching it to be printed. And ads we usually measured response, learned what was \"effective\".\n\nExploring through understanding what needed to be done through research and ideas and looping that back in were the done thing. My point about George Gallop at NUX: If he could do that in the 1930s what is stopping you understanding your audience's reaction/response now?\n\nThere was also a greater respect for the production process and time needed for production. If an annual report needed a week to artwork it got a week to artwork. On web stuff that time was frequently chipped away.\n\n(An aside: The quality of the newspaper print we couldn’t control and this was accepted by clients, which always seems a fun comparison for modern front-end realisation through whatever browser/device combo, but another tale for another day).\n\nI made the flip back to being digitally focused when I left Brahm in 2009, with the hope of creating things the way I’d seen in “ad world”.\n\nIn short: we can these days thanks to frameworks, not just in front-end and back-end build, but also the way can design.\n\nOver the past few years the most visibly open design “thing” in Leeds - for me - has been [SDLeeds](https://twitter.com/sdleeds), from the little get-togethers [Kathryn](https://twitter.com/iamkathryngrace) and [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattedgar) organised to the culmination of bigger events, like jams. The best thing is the focus of the chats is about *design* - design needing to be around users, audiences, and the like, so we create things that work for people - and *doing*.\n\nIt seems obvious to say it. Design for people, and test that design. But how often are designs based on an individual’s assumptions, and escalate from there? Getting the focus on the user from the off, taking an assumption, recognising it as an assumption, testing it, and then validating/learning? Not so. (This was another point at NUX.)\n\nThere are also so many layers and levels of structure, of design - not just the pictures, fonts, colours, and layout. I’ve never hung my hat on a particular design peg, other than focusing on coming up with things that are actually usable and effective. That's something I like about service design (and user-centred design).\n\nThe service design focused get-togethers in Leeds means we have some great explorations of users and ideas. [I was at last year’s GovJam](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/leeds-govjam-2014/) (as part of the organising team) and a room full of people who are focused on designing for people is just awesome to see. It’s also a warm welcoming environment to learn in, whether you’re a designer or not. And it’s not about “digital” and “non-digital” (one of my top peeves). It’s just about stuff, about things, and trying those ideas, those assumptions out. It reminds me of being at school, which all the best \"working environments\" are to me. (Again, another point I made at NUX.)\n\nIf you are involved maker of things are you going to GovJam? Good stuff! You’re not? You should do something about that. It's not too late to get down to GovJam in Leeds. And if it that isn't possible, [follow the event on Twitter](www.twitter.com/leedsgovjam). Or think about going to [NUX Camp](http://2015.nuxcamp.uk/) on Monday 22 June.\n\nTwo great design events. Two great design events in Leeds. Two great events focused on designing for users and both events will need your participation.

I think it's one of the few events I've been to where just about everything seemed to *click*.\n\nI couldn't make the Wednesday of the jam so coming in on Thursday was a good barometer of progress for the jam.

And it was *just happening* here.\n\nAt the back of my mind was the only downside I felt from last year's Leeds GovJam ([noted here](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/leeds-govjam-2014/)): 'A few thinking \"Not sure my boss will agree/understand/get this.\"' There was none of that that I heard. This year's Leeds GovJam went way beyond that reservation.\n\nSome people were almost fearless and optimistic: \"We'll work out a way this could happen.\" They literally wanted to make this thing they were doing happen out in the real world!\n\nOne team had thought through the business case for their project to make it seem viable to get running out there: \"Start small, build up.\"\n\nAnother project that was thought up, turns up something very similar was already simmering within Leeds council. \"We're going to link up so we can share our thoughts and energy.\"\n\nAnd another team were thinking of ways they could get some funding to make their idea happen.\n\nThere's a lot of talk these days on the idea of a something having *legacy*.

But through the exploration of real world problems and the teams thinking how they could make their ideas happen, it does feel this year's Leeds GovJam could be the starting point for a number of potentially effective actions.

The benefits of the Shipley to Leeds commute, eh.\n\nI earwigged a conversation the other day, the general gist was creating visuals in Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”, whatever the circumstance.\n\nThe only way. To create. A good prototype.\n\nA good prototype.\n\nRemember [the definition of *prototype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype).\n\n> A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.\n\nPrototypes are there to allow you to explore an idea, a thought, a theory, an approach. How that prototype manifests is totally up to you.\n\nPhotoshop is cool. As are all the various other ways: paper and pens, Pop, Marvel, Sketch, Keynote, using a code framework, acting, and so on.\n\nIf you are more comfortable with a certain way of prototyping over everything else, great, good for you. But there is no *one way* to creating prototypes, let alone *one way* to create a “good prototype”.\n\nA “good prototype” takes into account what we are exploring. If we are exploring a particular medium then maybe Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”. But, again, Photoshop over Sketch, Keynote etc?

If you took the time out to contact me, thank you! It's good to see something that's me just having a play was described as \"useful\"!\n\nA few asked if it was possible to apply the same approach to Amazon wishlists. So I've had a go at that.\n\nKnowing I could have a chance of a spare half hour early evening, I did a little research while walking the dog. One of the first problems was Amazon wishlists are not like their bestseller pages - they do not provide readily formatted data for us to just pick up (the bestsellers has RSS/XML feeds we could just look up).\n\nHowever, HTML is data of its own kind, so I had a look at the code of a wishlist page (which you can do too - go to your wishlist page and select the *view code* option in your browser, if you're curious) and found that all my wishlist entries had a little bit of information against them that indicated they were *wishlist items*: `a id=\"itemName_`\n\nSo I wrote a little bit of code that takes in the HTML code for my wishlist page. It then looks for all the lines with `a id=\"itemName_` on and stores a list of them.\n\nUnfortunately I was only working on the first page of my wishlist so this meant I only had my most recent 20 entries on my wishlist to work with. At the same time, this made life a little easier as it meant I was only working with 20 entries!\n\nI then extracted all the data on each line by pulling out anything that was between speech marks - there are four items per line. But I only needed to show the second and fourth: *the book name* and *the book's URL on Amazon*.\n\nKnowing we only had 20 books' details the program enters a loop, working through a book at a time to show stuff on screen for visitors to the web page.\n\nThe loop displays the book name, simple enough. Then I wanted to create a URL to a library system. If you remember last week's effort, we needed the ISBN number to feed into the library system. This is in the Amazon URL, so I wrote a little bit of code that lifted that 10 character code out of the URL and \"spits it out\" as part of a web link (to the Leeds libraries system).\n\nLast week I also discovered that Kindle books make up a big part of my wishlist and the library systems don't seem to return those. Again I intriduced a \"warning\" - Kindle books seems to have an ISBN that starts with *B*, so the code runs a quick check. If the ISBN starts with B, put a little warning up.\n\nAnd that's it! Total time spent: just less than an hour this time. (And not including the little bit of research while I was out with the dog.)\n\nYou can view my wishlist by visiting [www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=39JNF1CTQYIJ1](http://www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=39JNF1CTQYIJ1)\n\nIf you want to insert your wishlist, take the web address below. Do you see everything after`wishlist=`? Replace that with your wishlist ID. You can find by visiting your wishlist on Amazon. My wishlist URL is `http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/39JNF1CTQYIJ1` You can see my wishlist ID is everything after that last `/`: `39JNF1CTQYIJ1`. Can you see that in the URL? That's what you need to find and replace!\n\nSo, if your wishlist ID is `ABCDEFGHIJKLM` you can create your look-up page with the URL `www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=ABCDEFGHIJKLM`\n\nIf you live in Bradford you can force my system to search Bradford libraries, by adding `&location=bradford` into the URL. So: `www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=YourWishlistID&location=bradford`.\n\nSo, my wishlist look-up pushing a search into Bradford libraries' system is [www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=39JNF1CTQYIJ1&location=bradford](http://www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=39JNF1CTQYIJ1&location=bradford)\n\nNone of your data is taken and stored by this system, by the way. It just looks up your page \"on the fly\", pulls out what it needs to show it, and that's it. Nothing is squirreled away secretly.\n\nLikewise, any council library system that uses the Capita Discovery system can be \"used\", like Barnsley's. The Capita Discovery \"location\" for Barnsley is `barnsleymbc`. So the URL is `www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-wishlist.php?wishlist=YourWishlistID&location=barnsleymbc`. Maybe at some point I could get a list of all the libraries that use the Capita Discovery system.\n\nAnd that's it. Thanks again if you replied last week.

It wasn’t.\n\nWhile we couldn’t go out and about so much without my mum having to wrap up, the school day ended at lunch (although started somewhere near 7am), we had a swimming pool, I read loads (Orwell...), I watched loads of films (1987 was the year I saw *Ferris Bueller’s Day Off*, *the Goonies*, *Aliens*, *Hannah and Her Sisters*, and the Paul Schrader version of *Cat People* for the first time), and we had KFC at the end of my dad’s working week.\n\nOne day, near Christmas of 1987, my mum bought me a Commodore 64. I say “me”, but I think it was really for all of us. I just got the most out of it.\n\nAnd, yes, my mum got it because it’d [help with my homework](http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/), somehow.\n\nThe Commodore 64 came with a really good manual. And I do mean really good. It explained a lot about the machine and how to use it. It explained how to program the machine. It had to.\n\nIf I wanted to load something from a disk drive I had to type in a command. I didn’t just put the disk into the drive and it loaded automatically, like a DVD would do these days.\n\nI had to type `LOAD “*”,8,1`.\n\nThe disk drive would whirr, crank, and purr as it loaded in whatever it found not the floppy disk.\n\nSo really, that was the first bit of computer programming I did. Getting the computer to load something. (It might have been Monopoly. My mum bought something recognisable. It was a couple of weeks before we chanced onto Winter Games from Epyx and my life was really changed.)\n\nA lot of people talk of the mystical/mythical [HELLO WORLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) as their first piece of programming. I cannot remember doing that as mine. It had to be loading in the disk.\n\nAfter that? I got bored of Monopoly - and read the manual fully. Looking back it was an *excellent* manual, with a very engaging example based tone. I must have done the exercises in the manual one by one.\n\nEarly on in the manual it introduces you to a programming language called BASIC. It was quite a simple language to learn. The first example of code (that didn’t load anything in) was very early on in the manual.\n\n`PRINT “I LOVE MY COMMODORE”`\n\nI typed this, hit the return key, and on screen the computer told me `I LOVE MY COMMODORE`.\n\nI also remember the first command that felt like I was making the computer “do my homework”. There was an example in the manual for a simple maths problem.\n\n`PRINT 12 + 12`\n\nI typed that in, hit the return key.\n\nThe computer replied `24`. Fast! I gave it a few, admittedly simple, maths problems, possibly in the hope I'd catch it out, it'd get one wrong.\n\nI quickly learnt that instead of `x` for multiply I needed to use `*`.  For `÷` I needed `/`. \n\nI then learnt I could store values in `variables`.\n\n`LET X = 28 + Y`\n\nPut into `X` the sum of `28` and `Y`. And `Y` was a variable.\n\nSo my program could've been:\n\n`10 Y = 3\n20 LET X = 28 + Y\n30 PRINT X`\n\nAnd while I didn't do the `HELLO WORLD` thing I did learn about loops a different way!\n\n`10 PRINT “MY NAME IS SIMON”\n20 GOTO 20`\n\nOn my screen - a TV the computer was plugged into - the computer printed MY NAME IS SIMON over and over and over and over (like a monkey with a miniature cymbal) until I forced the program to stop.\n\nFrom going through the early half of the Commodore 64 manual I learnt concepts then that shaped my coding:\n\n* How to display something\n* How to store information\n* How to manipulate information\n* How to loop\n* Think about the design of my computer program before I started.\n\n...which in short is everything you need to get up and running if you want to go \"full code\". And a lot of these programs were simple, short. But they were done in an environment that presented me with no option but to type something in, allowing me manipulate my machine.\n\nNow in 2015 we usually don’t see that. We interact through more visual means. We click on icons to open apps. Clicking that icon is just telling the device you are using to launch a particular program of code.\n\nIf we want to \"do the code\" we usually have to launch something to let us do that, an MS Dos prompt, Terminal, or some such.\n\nThe distinction between code and technology is important. Technology isn’t just about coding - and also coding isn’t just about technology. But being able to code the technology isn't as simple now as it was for me back in 1987, especially when you throw in all the devices and languages out there now. It *is* overwhelming - but there's no reason why it should be. Programming, coding exists in places you might not realise as well, such in spreadsheets (like Excel).\n\nCoding for me was fun - and still is fun. It helps me, it lets me make things. I don't consider myself a \"professional coder\". I've learnt off my own back, learning and doing in-between all sorts of other stuff. (And I still learn and do it in-between all sorts of other stuff.) My code is not lean, not optimised and what have you (and this has been ruthlessly pointed out to me by \"better coders\" in the past), but my code does a job. I still get a thrill when I upload a piece of PHP code to a web server and my program runs.\n\nAnd that's what matters most: *I* am getting a computer to do something for *me*, whether it is functional or (made up word alert) funtional.","html":"<p>I remember the first time I did a bit of computer programming on my own computer.</p>\n\n<p>It was 1987.

([It’s here on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rnarang.android.games.jacknjill&hl=en_GB) and [over here on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jack-n-jill/id686985871?mt=8).) It’s rare these days to reach the scripted end of a game, especially on a mobile game.\n\nWhile a lover of computer and console games, I really have a love-hate relationship with mobile games, as well as browser-based games. Very few are mindful of the limitations those environments set, let alone take advantage of the platforms to create something half-decent.\n\nIn short: Most mobile phone and browser-based games are rubbish.\n\nJack N’ Jill is mindful that it is *a game on a mobile phone*. You control the character with a “tap screen to control” approach rather than trying to emulate a console controller on-screen. The game starts as a standard [endless runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game#Endless_running_games) where the player taps the screen to make the character - Jack - jump from platform to platform, with the goal of reaching Jill at the end of every level.\n\nFall off the bottom of the level? Life used up. Hit a bad dude? Life used up. Fall against some spikes? Life used up. Each time you start again, from the start of the level or the most recent mid-level restart point (which are introduced later in the game).\n\nAs the game progresses the character can jump onto walls to jump off, bounce off baddies when landing on them, and collect wings to do a bit of Flappy Birding. There’s 140 levels split into groups of 20 where new game mechanisms are introduced. The graphics are very Gameboy, the tunes are alright.\n\nAnd for the most part it’s quite enjoyable. There’s the odd really frustrating level, but I know it’s me and my timing of input not the game itself. At times the game made me feel like a terrible gamer, my skills weren’t up to it. The game plays very few tricks - there's the odd really tight squeeze, an occasional pixel perfect jump, and a couple of points I *really* had to know the level map ahead to progress. But I knew it was me.\n\nOverall it’s taken about six months to get to the end. When I got there, I felt pretty good. I had beaten the game. It felt *rewarding*.\n\n---\n\nI was also watching some of the Tour de France at the weekend. Great times in Yorkshire last year as the famous cycle race kicked off in the county.\n\nI was reminded of a browser-based game I played last summer, part of Yorkshire Building Society’s campaign around their sponsoring the Tour de France’s [Grand Depart in Yorkshire](http://letour.yorkshire.com/). The campaign itself was great, some good use of media and some inventive creative. Along with the campaign came a web-based game.\n\nI wrote at the time:\n\n>This is less a game made *to enjoy* but *to endure*. The controls are barely described to the user, and even then seem erratic to respond. There is no commitment that a game should be tied down to learning patterns to progress but the speed obstacles come at you combined with the vague sense of control here makes this more a game of chance than a game of skill.\n\n>I can’t decide: Is this a game that is badly designed, is it designed people who actually get why people play games? It is clearly designed to deliberately frustrate. But the more I play it the more I feel it is a game that has been designed by people who actually hate gamers.\n\n>Every time I play the game, every time my rider falls off his bike I just can't evade the obstacle. I feel helpless, like the game is designed to beat me at some point, the sooner the better. I persisted. There must be *something* in there. Playing it drove me to rage, my hands turning to clenched fists every time. I gave up after 40 minutes.\n\nCompare to Jack N' Jill, which was frustrating, but was designed to be something you progressed through, something you felt you had a sense of control over, had a sense of progress?\n\nThe YBS TdF game had a really pleasing visual retro-esque aesthetic and looks lively with its bright colours and seemingly simple gameplay (although it does that mixing pixelated and non-pixelated approach I find uneasy), which drew my son to it. He had several goes and made no progress. \"That's not just fun,\" was his review.

I’m just coming to the end of my third week at HM Revenue & Customs, as part of the impressive Digital Delivery Centre (DDC) in Newcastle.\n\nThere’s plenty of documented experiences of working at places like [GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), but not a lot about the wider digital government family, including HMRC where I am based.\n\nIt’s a tasty gig, an opportunity to make things that matter, services that anyone in the UK could use: It’s reported that 70% of all government transactions come through HMRC. That’s a lot of service users.\n\nI’ve done “public sector” stuff a lot, but not in a way that allows me just to focus wholly on the tasks in-hand. Public sector stuff in the past has been project work I've done amongst other stuff. Immersion in and dedication of time to the organisation and its problems was and is a major attraction, along with working with a team of good people. This is *my job*.\n\nThe biggest swinger though was my interview. Less a grilling, more just a really good - and honest - hour long chat. *This is the good, this is the stuff we need to work on, we want to get on with stuff, how are you with that?*\n\nWhen I got the offer to join the only thing that stopped me saying YES! straight away was making sure my wife and kids would be OK with me being away during the week. And this chance came in the face of other opportunities that would been more local to my Idle home, have had me “higher up the tree”, and financially more lucrative. It’s a big ask, but this is also a big opportunity, one that'd be in the heat of the action. I’d been looking further away from the Leeds area, more to find a big challenge.\n\nAnd it is a challenge.\n\nAt the moment I am working across two teams making HMRC’s Inheritance Tax digital service as an *interaction designer* (not a UX designer, which I'll clarify shortly).\n\nI’ve joined in the last sprint, a two week sprint, before the service goes into private beta.\n\nIt’s not been easy. It’s been the toughest challenge I’ve taken on for some years. A lot of absorbing, a lot of initial fuzzy head, a lot of long days to absorb all the things, and understand why the service is where it is. Irrespective of what we can learn during the beta release, there’s a deadline to get something together that users *want* and can use. There's been a lot of hard work from the team so far - we've still needed to pull a lot of strings together. And while living out of a suitcase.\n\nLike I said it's a challenge, a tasty one.\n\nBut the past week it's been clicking, it's been incredibly productive. As the interaction designer on the service I am there to (briefly - I will pick this up in another post later) design what the user interacts with.\n\nI am not there as user experience designer. I am repeatedly saying **User experience comes from the team not from one person, not from one role**. All the efforts of the teams contribute to *make the service*, all the efforts *design the service*, drawing upon the collaboration between scrum master, product owner, business analyst, research squad, content designer, the developers, and the QA team. With such a user-centric *philosophy* (rather than *approach*) ego isn’t an input in this work.\n\nThe manifestation of stuff on-screen, in-browser is the best place to check over how something comes together - and user research is the best way to understand how it works, how it can be improved. (And it's great to have dedicated and good user research people in the team - and making something for users is known by all.)\n\nThere’s an acceptance that nimbleness means there’s no one way of doing things, there are many right ways of getting stuff done. I’ve used everything from pens onto paper and whiteboard walls, Keynote, Sketch, and coding with the framework, as well as exposing the team to some new tools like Invision. Getting stuff thought through, down in an appropriate form, and then realising it with the team (not just slinging it across).\n\nI’ve an excitement as the private beta release of the service approaches, where we’ll get some meatier insight into what we’ve done so far, and feed that back into the creation cycle. Can we make the service simpler, clearer, and faster for the users?\n\nOh, a point on the use of the word *service*. Interestingly not once while I have been in the building has anyone referred to what we are working on as a *website*. We’re making services, digitally enabled, accessible across the internet, sure but it’s a refreshing frame of mind to not use the word *website*.\n\nThe DDC is buzzing. I think there’s about 300 people there. *Community* is a word banded around the place, and it’s not an aspiration. Community is an actuality. The designers have regular “community meetings”. Everyone contributes to design, and “crits” are friendly, constructive affairs. It’s not about “My design needs to be the one that wins.” It’s about putting forward stuff as theories and validating them, then improving where we can.\n\nThe sense of community is also strong in the project teams I work with, a sense of neighbourliness, polite nosiness, and offers of help. It’s great!\n\nThe building in Newcastle is pretty amazing. It’s huge, spacious, airy. An atrium that runs down the middle of the building has lots of breakout areas, [an awesome high roof](https://instagram.com/p/56_-bUIseX/), plenty of natural light. It’s a place where you can just get on with doing work. \n\nFor the sense of balance you want a downside? There is stuff we need to work on, sure, we're aware. But chiefly we could do with more cake around the place - and I’m working on that.","html":"<p>I’ve a spare half hour, a good chance to get some thoughts down on my new gig.

It’s not about “My design needs to be the one that wins.” It’s about putting forward stuff as theories and validating them, then improving where we can.</p>\n\n<p>The sense of community is also strong in the project teams I work with, a sense of neighbourliness, polite nosiness, and offers of help. It’s great!</p>\n\n<p>The building in Newcastle is pretty amazing. It’s huge, spacious, airy. An atrium that runs down the middle of the building has lots of breakout areas, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/56_-bUIseX/\">an awesome high roof</a>, plenty of natural light. It’s a place where you can just get on with doing work. </p>\n\n<p>For the sense of balance you want a downside? There is stuff we need to work on, sure, we're aware. But chiefly we could do with more cake around the place - and I’m working on that.</p>","image":"","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-08-06T19:58:39.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-10-29T11:21:24.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-08-06T20:16:30.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":80,"uuid":"95f3712b-3fc8-4569-8a13-50d0db57bf10","title":"Thunk.","slug":"thunk","markdown":"A few years ago, at the place I worked at back then, there were several doors into the office.

That is design.\n\nThere may be someone who can \"do pretty design\". But it is never about an individual. Design isn’t about an individual ego. It’s about what the team of people working together do. No one person can ever claim the glory.\n\nDesign is the team’s work.\n\nDesign is teamwork.\n\nps, if you do want it to be pretty?

We want to go on a sunny holiday this year.” You pick up the phone, ring what is probably a call centre, who talk to you in a tone and with questions that have been <em>designed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The whole thing: <em>Designed</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I could keep going on with examples, but I hope you get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>Design is a team of people working together to make a thing. They bring their specialist design skills to the work.</p>\n\n<p>Each uses research, evaluation, and then proposes a design solution through their eyes. </p>\n\n<p>Each of those people brings their design strengths to the table, adding into everyone else’s design focus.</p>\n\n<p>That is their responsibility into the overall design. That is design.</p>\n\n<p>There may be someone who can \"do pretty design\". But it is never about an individual. Design isn’t about an individual ego. It’s about what the team of people working together do. No one person can ever claim the glory.</p>\n\n<p>Design is the team’s work.</p>\n\n<p>Design is teamwork.</p>\n\n<p>ps, if you do want it to be pretty? Get a <em>visual</em> designer on that, maybe a <em>graphic designer</em>. Thank me later.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/09/2986989396_c22e020b51_o.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-09-14T07:13:32.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-09-30T18:52:05.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-09-14T07:20:35.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":87,"uuid":"68ce0586-692d-4d7b-a640-c1678e47b2a7","title":"Some short notes about show and tells at HMRC Digital","slug":"some-short-slides-on-prototypes","markdown":"After lunch every Monday we have a \"community show and tell\" in Newcastle.\n\nEach of us being buried away in our agile teams it's often difficult to breakaway from the day-to-day, hour-to-hour hurly-burly. These weekly hour-long sessions are great opportunities for designers to get together, share their work, their thoughts, and have some productive discussion.\n\nWe cycle between an interaction design only meeting one week, and the next week we have joint interaction and content design meeting.\n\nThis week I led the session to talk about the work I'd been doing recently, and to delve a little in the idea of \"prototype\".\n\nOn the service I am on I've used two [Google Ventures design sprints](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) (a week each) within one of our sprints (two weeks) to pull together a new prototype that focuses on insights from user research - and explore ways of meeting those needs.\n\n(Protip: I highly recommend you don't take this approach if you've other stuff on top of this.

It's not fun finishing off your work at 2am and having to get up four hours later to head off for a long day of user research.)\n\n####The problem with 'prototype'\nUp front I spied one slight issue with this week's show and tell: There's a sliding scale on how people define prototypes.\n\nSome see them as a thing that tests something. (Which I do, [as blogged about here](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/a-short-note-about-prototyping/).)\n\nOthers, at the other end of the scale, can see prototypes as a sort, say, of hyper-rich specification, if you will, that they can use to do a full build against.\n\nFor the show and tell session I wanted to quickly get across what I feel a prototype is, get that definition shared up front, understood, as prep for what they were about to go through.\n\nThe prototype I showed - running off my Macbook, made using the GDS prototype kit, hooked up to a big screen - was firmly in the former logic.

Examples of \"prototypes\" in the wild, in popular culture aren't that prevalent. But there's one in Iron Man 3. So I cadged that. It's a decent one. (I know I borrow from the Marvel Cinematic Universe a lot. Why wouldn't I?)\n\nWhy borrow from pop culture? It's something the audience has a decent chance of having seen.

The last slide was a setter for the themes I'd be addressing during the prototype exploration after these slides. There's nothing contentious in there. (I'm not the biggest fan of bullet points, but, again, expectancy for my colleagues in the room.)\n\nTrue to how we approach the show and tells, this session turned out to be an honest and open forum about what I showed. I keep emphasising it, but in the HMRC Digital design team we are big on sharing our thoughts, exploring together and using the team's deep experience.

It’s not that big a number. It's early double digits of weeks. Maybe eleven. I don’t know exactly how long.\n\nSince I wrote my [three weeks up](//www.ermlikeyeah.com/hmrc-nearly-three-weeks-up/) post I’ve done a lot more: Absorbed more, learnt more, taught a lot more, traveled more, and made more. It’s been more full-on than those jam-packed first few weeks.\n\nI still bump into friends for the first time since I moved inside, and some ask why I took the role. I touched on some of that before, in the earlier post. There’s still a myriad of other reasons, and I'll come to some here.\n\nAnother frequent question I get asked — and there are two forms:\n\n* What is it like to work *under* GDS? \n* What is it like to work *with* GDS?\n\nThere’s an intertwined answer to both of those.\n\n####2.\nI’ve been at places where there is nothing to work from, no structure, no commonly accepted way of working. There’s no process. There’s no way of getting the work through. There’s no understanding of who does what and why. On projects when there’s been no *brand guidelines*. And ad work where you're a second tier agency doing some DM for a big brand working from a PDF supplied by the \"big agency\". (And then get an arsey email from the client saying that's not quite the right font and we get super-fruity because What Do They Fucking Expect When They Don't Send Us The Proper Artwork And Fonts To Work From, Eh?.)\n\nEverything just *happens*, by the will, the desire, the talent, and — to a lesser extent — the experience of the people. Somehow it gets done, and usually it is agonising. (And usually not sustainable.)\n\n####3.\nI’ve been at places where I have gone in and there is some form of structure — but no consistency to the way of work.\n\nI’ve been at places where there is a way of working set down, but the people just don’t dig it. (Might have been responsible for that once, ahem.)\n\nI’ve also been at places where there was a recognised and consistent way of working. (I was sort of, um, responsible for that at several places, but the people collectively did the actual work. I just set it up and policed it, and tweaked it when needed.)\n\nI was going for a director of something role once and in the interview asked:\n\n>What's better: To start from nothing, or To start with something?\n\nI answered:\n\n>It is always best to start with something, as long as that something *works*. If it doesn’t work, I would want to start with nothing — but make sure there is the intent to set up something that *works*.\n\nFYI, I didn't get the job.\n\n####4.\n[GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) is now about four years old. There are people at GDS who are experienced, who know their shit, who have started with nothing other than their brains, their wits, and their goodwill. And they created something that is recognised — and not just in a bandwagon-jumping way — as *good*. And that something isn’t easy to create.\n\nAll that work manifests as the current 18 point [Digital by Default Service Standard](http://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default).\n\n18 points. 18 points for doing good work.\n\nThere's also the design patterns GDS have pulled together, reviewed constantly, from the work they do, the research work, the design work.\n\nBoth are great platforms for doing work. GDS's efforts are awesome, a lot of hard slog to work it out, work it through, and set it down. And go about that in a way that has engagement, that has investment, that people see the value of.\n\nAnd it’s not GDS’s — it openly, publicly available. The GDS way is to *make things open, it makes them better*. It's out there, for you, anyone to pick up and use. Response, reaction to the things GDS do is part of their make-up. Listening and then acting on what they hear.\n\n####5.\nOne of the reasons I signed up to work at HMRC is the immense potential in actually embracing user-centred design to make digitally enabled services. These services are not just used by citizens and businesses, but also the staff within HMRC. And that's *embracing user-centred design*, actually using it as a way of working, not just paying it lip service.\n\nLast week I went to Nottingham and saw rooms full of paper forms, recent paper forms. It’s the most manual, the most non-digital process I have seen for years. And there is a lot more of this within government.\n\nOn that one trip the immense transformative effect of creating digitally driven services was right there. If users could enter their information through the web it could be fed straight into databases, with that information practically being immediately available. The users could get responses, decisions so much faster.\n\nThe transformative effect GDS already have created is noteworthy. That HMRC uses the Digital by Default Service Standard created by GDS as a platform to make their digital services, is an exciting prospect for those who truly believe in the change user-centred digital services can bring.\n\nBuild on the shoulders of giants, eh.\n\n####6.\nPeople don’t strive for uniformity in the way they work, they just want consistency — with the room to adapt, to wiggle when needed.\n\nPeople join places because they want an assurance of a way of working. A platform like the Digital by Default Service Standard, is a Good Thing. It means you can look up, go “Alright then”, and get on, acclimatised. If you're a little unsure, the Standards, the design patterns are concise enough to check in on. You know what you should be doing. And it's not about handcuffs or strait jackets - there's plenty of room on how you go about doing it.\n\nSo, when people ask why I joined HMRC I say because there’s a chance to create positive change — and appropriate change from understanding users. Change not just by creating *digital* services but by creating *services full stop*, services that the British people can use and can understand. And creating those services on a good platform for work.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's easy. It’s hard. It’s really fucking hard. But it isn’t the hardest thing you can do.\n\nThat is starting with nothing.\n\nThat is starting with a bad thing.\n\nTry either.\n\nI have. They’re not just fucking hard, but they're fucking awful. Those are the hardest you can do.\n\n####7.\nPeople sometimes assume I joined because of Ben Terrett. It's not. And it's not because of Mike Bracken. And it’s not because of Tom Loosemore. And it’s not because of Russell Davies. And it's not because of any other person at GDS. It’s not because of any one person in particular. (Although after a couple of beers I would possibly have Russell, so to speak.)\n\nIt’s because of the work they all led, they all contributed to, that they all did with a much wider group of people, to create and set down approaches that you can confidently use as springboards, as a platform.\n\nAnd, yes, there’s the chance to work *with* GDS. And note, *with*. Not under. Not trying to beat. Not trying to outmaneuver. Not trying to avoid. *With*.\n\nGDS created the Service Standard working on the initial services they took on.\n\n####8.\nWe - at HMRC - are getting to apply that on the services that HMRC look after. Some really big services. Some really tough services. Some services you will go back to regularly. Some services you will use once, but dip in and out of several times over a few months.\n\nWe'll be using and testing the Service Standard ourselves.\n\nWe'll also be using and testing the heavily researched design patterns GDS have also created as a platform.\n\nWe'll be feeding back into both because the real fun starts now.\n\nBut it's great to know we have a great platform to work from, to work with. And it's great to know we have GDS to help us.","html":"<h4 id=\"1\">1.</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve lost count of how long I’ve been working for HMRC on creating their digital services.

There’s still a myriad of other reasons, and I'll come to some here.</p>\n\n<p>Another frequent question I get asked — and there are two forms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is it like to work <em>under</em> GDS? </li>\n<li>What is it like to work <em>with</em> GDS?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s an intertwined answer to both of those.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2\">2.</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve been at places where there is nothing to work from, no structure, no commonly accepted way of working. There’s no process. There’s no way of getting the work through. There’s no understanding of who does what and why. On projects when there’s been no <em>brand guidelines</em>. And ad work where you're a second tier agency doing some DM for a big brand working from a PDF supplied by the \"big agency\". (And then get an arsey email from the client saying that's not quite the right font and we get super-fruity because What Do They Fucking Expect When They Don't Send Us The Proper Artwork And Fonts To Work From, Eh?.)</p>\n\n<p>Everything just <em>happens</em>, by the will, the desire, the talent, and — to a lesser extent — the experience of the people. Somehow it gets done, and usually it is agonising. (And usually not sustainable.)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3\">3.</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve been at places where I have gone in and there is some form of structure — but no consistency to the way of work.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been at places where there is a way of working set down, but the people just don’t dig it. (Might have been responsible for that once, ahem.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve also been at places where there was a recognised and consistent way of working. (I was sort of, um, responsible for that at several places, but the people collectively did the actual work. I just set it up and policed it, and tweaked it when needed.)</p>\n\n<p>I was going for a director of something role once and in the interview asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What's better: To start from nothing, or To start with something?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I answered:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is always best to start with something, as long as that something <em>works</em>. If it doesn’t work, I would want to start with nothing — but make sure there is the intent to set up something that <em>works</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>FYI, I didn't get the job.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4\">4.</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service\">GDS</a> is now about four years old. There are people at GDS who are experienced, who know their shit, who have started with nothing other than their brains, their wits, and their goodwill. And they created something that is recognised — and not just in a bandwagon-jumping way — as <em>good</em>. And that something isn’t easy to create.</p>\n\n<p>All that work manifests as the current 18 point <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default\">Digital by Default Service Standard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>18 points. 18 points for doing good work.</p>\n\n<p>There's also the design patterns GDS have pulled together, reviewed constantly, from the work they do, the research work, the design work.</p>\n\n<p>Both are great platforms for doing work. GDS's efforts are awesome, a lot of hard slog to work it out, work it through, and set it down. And go about that in a way that has engagement, that has investment, that people see the value of.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s not GDS’s — it openly, publicly available. The GDS way is to <em>make things open, it makes them better</em>. It's out there, for you, anyone to pick up and use. Response, reaction to the things GDS do is part of their make-up. Listening and then acting on what they hear.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"5\">5.</h4>\n\n<p>One of the reasons I signed up to work at HMRC is the immense potential in actually embracing user-centred design to make digitally enabled services. These services are not just used by citizens and businesses, but also the staff within HMRC. And that's <em>embracing user-centred design</em>, actually using it as a way of working, not just paying it lip service.</p>\n\n<p>Last week I went to Nottingham and saw rooms full of paper forms, recent paper forms. It’s the most manual, the most non-digital process I have seen for years. And there is a lot more of this within government.</p>\n\n<p>On that one trip the immense transformative effect of creating digitally driven services was right there. If users could enter their information through the web it could be fed straight into databases, with that information practically being immediately available. The users could get responses, decisions so much faster.</p>\n\n<p>The transformative effect GDS already have created is noteworthy. That HMRC uses the Digital by Default Service Standard created by GDS as a platform to make their digital services, is an exciting prospect for those who truly believe in the change user-centred digital services can bring.</p>\n\n<p>Build on the shoulders of giants, eh.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"6\">6.</h4>\n\n<p>People don’t strive for uniformity in the way they work, they just want consistency — with the room to adapt, to wiggle when needed.</p>\n\n<p>People join places because they want an assurance of a way of working. A platform like the Digital by Default Service Standard, is a Good Thing. It means you can look up, go “Alright then”, and get on, acclimatised. If you're a little unsure, the Standards, the design patterns are concise enough to check in on. You know what you should be doing. And it's not about handcuffs or strait jackets - there's plenty of room on how you go about doing it.</p>\n\n<p>So, when people ask why I joined HMRC I say because there’s a chance to create positive change — and appropriate change from understanding users. Change not just by creating <em>digital</em> services but by creating <em>services full stop</em>, services that the British people can use and can understand. And creating those services on a good platform for work.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn't mean it's easy. It’s hard. It’s really fucking hard. But it isn’t the hardest thing you can do.</p>\n\n<p>That is starting with nothing.</p>\n\n<p>That is starting with a bad thing.</p>\n\n<p>Try either.</p>\n\n<p>I have. They’re not just fucking hard, but they're fucking awful. Those are the hardest you can do.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"7\">7.</h4>\n\n<p>People sometimes assume I joined because of Ben Terrett. It's not. And it's not because of Mike Bracken. And it’s not because of Tom Loosemore. And it’s not because of Russell Davies. And it's not because of any other person at GDS. It’s not because of any one person in particular. (Although after a couple of beers I would possibly have Russell, so to speak.)</p>\n\n<p>It’s because of the work they all led, they all contributed to, that they all did with a much wider group of people, to create and set down approaches that you can confidently use as springboards, as a platform.</p>\n\n<p>And, yes, there’s the chance to work <em>with</em> GDS. And note, <em>with</em>. Not under. Not trying to beat. Not trying to outmaneuver. Not trying to avoid. <em>With</em>.</p>\n\n<p>GDS created the Service Standard working on the initial services they took on.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"8\">8.</h4>\n\n<p>We - at HMRC - are getting to apply that on the services that HMRC look after. Some really big services. Some really tough services. Some services you will go back to regularly. Some services you will use once, but dip in and out of several times over a few months.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be using and testing the Service Standard ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>We'll also be using and testing the heavily researched design patterns GDS have also created as a platform.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be feeding back into both because the real fun starts now.</p>\n\n<p>But it's great to know we have a great platform to work from, to work with. And it's great to know we have GDS to help us.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/09/moira.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-09-30T15:10:45.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-09-30T19:01:23.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-09-29T19:30:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":91,"uuid":"10a9ecf5-335e-4bff-a396-a2c7f39bdaf5","title":"Plain speaking","slug":"plain-speaking","markdown":"A great post by [Leisa Reichelt](https://twitter.com/leisa) – the recenly departed head of user reasearch at GDS – for the weekend (and beyond once you've read it) on [Stop your team using technical terms and jargon](http://www.disambiguity.com/stop-your-team-using-technical-terms-and-jargon/).

Variations on a tried-and-tested theme, usually only differentiated by some Branding (that they’ve come up themselves) to give an idea of separation from a competitor’s Pretty Much The Same Approach, but, y’know, the words and graphical treatment makes if Stand Out. (Agencies are all about the Stand Out.)\n\nBut, tongue out of cheek now, the fact they openly recognize a Process For Doing Work gives the impression the Process Is Important.\n\nAnd they are quite right. It is important.\n\nDefining how work should be done allows people to know what they should do to get work done. It’s about defining the frame of mind and giving permission to go about stuff in a certain way.\n\nUsually this is for spelt out openly for the benefit of clients, usually potential ones. It recognises, it shows openly organisations have thought through how to get something intangible in, and then out of the door as something tangible.\n\nAnd, again, quite right.\n\n####2\nIncreasingly the Process has become as important, if not more important, to the employees of organisations, again usually potential ones.\n\nTo repeat: It recognises, it shows openly organisations have thought through how to get something intangible in, and then out of the door as something tangible.\n\n####3\nRecognising and acknowledging An Actual Process is the least praised part of the (and bear with me here) Making Process — and often the most neglected, the bit taken for granted.\n\nProcess has always been Something Acknowledged – but now in the industry/sector I work in it is used a comparator, a differentiator.\n\nThere are different ways of working. Of course there are.\n\nEven when The Process is a variant on Everyone’s Else’s Process, there’s different people in each of those organisations, irrespective of whether they are working on similar problems or facing different problems.\n\nDifferent people always means a difference.\n\n####4\nNow, more so than ever, people can move and will move between companies because there’s a genuine chance to work differently, in a way that isn’t just about working with different people.\n\nAnd it’s not different for difference’s sake.\n\nSometimes people move because they want to go somewhere that *understands how to get work done*.\n\nSometimes people move because they just want to *try* something different.\n\nWhether you’re a “client” or an “employee” there’s a line.\n\nSpelling out process on your website, in your pitches to potential clients in your decks, and in interviews to potential employees in handbooks is just a promise. \n\nDoing it is another.\n\n####5\n\n“Uncertainty” is a very human trait.\n\nWe instinctively fear the unknown and create logical (albeit not always rational) reasoning to create assurance.\n\nWe try to avoid uncertainty. Habit, structure, anticipation are all alleviators of uncertainty.\n\nThink of how you start the day.

I dealt in broad strokes previously.\n\nNow approaching three months on the job, I thought it might be useful to explore how we are approaching creating the inheritance tax digital online service with a user first approach.\n\nI joined the project a couple of months back and the team had already done some sterling work creating theoretical design approaches, going through these with users in research sessions, and adapting our work based on those responses. As design approaches are approved by users our developers create the digital service.\n\n####3\nInheritance tax itself is hard. I compare it to papier mâché.\n\nThe original rules were created. Think of them as the first layer, neat, and on recorded on paper. And as time has passed and little bits have been stuck on top, more and more little bits responding to situations, scenarios, where the rules have had to be created or changed. Inheritance tax is not alone on this. A lot of British policy and law is like this. It adapts to circumstances. This means though that this is hard.\n\n####4\nCreating the ability for citizens to submit inheritance tax information online is a long process. To help us bring the digital inheritance tax online we are carrying out two phases of work: one this year (2015), the second next year (2016). It is a big programme.\n\n(And remember laws and policy are always capable of change.)\n\nThis year’s work is focused on bringing online what is currently centred around the *205 inheritance tax paper form*.\n\nWhat this means as simple as possible: Anyone who fills in a 205 form and while doing that isn’t at any point directed away to any other inheritance tax form doesn’t have any inheritance tax to pay. A lot of the work being doing in this first phase is groundwork for any later phases.\n\n####5\nResearch is important to the way we work.\n\nWe want to *know*. As we work in government we have a lot of great insight to draw upon, and we work closely with the inheritance tax teams within government who have a lot of experience and knowledge. We also talk with our colleagues in other government agencies, including DWP and GDS.\n\nIf we don’t know, we care, we want to find out, digging deeper. There are plenty of ways we can get this understanding.\n\nIf we don’t get answers we will be working with assumptions, which is not a preferred way of designing and making.\n\nIf we *have to* work with an assumption to keep our work going, we look to validate (prove/disprove) that assumption as soon as we can, in the most appropriate way. Slight correction: We *make sure* we validate that assumption.\n\nWe do – after all – work with user needs.\n\n####6\nFrom research we know that the majority of people who fill in the current paper based 205 form will be doing this as a relative of someone has passed away.\n\nCollecting and organising this information is not the easiest process. This is amplified if you are looking to submit inheritance tax information for a close family member.\n\nIt is our goal to *make submitting the inheritance tax information as painless as we can*. We know it is not easy for the user for emotional reasons.\n\nWe also know collecting the information that is needed is not easy. It can take time to find. It can take time to look through. And it can take time to understand what exactly is needed for inheritance tax.\n\nWe don’t want to make it any harder. If anything, we want to make it easier.\n\n####7\nInheritance tax is policy driven: government has its needs. This, for the most part, means we need to acquire information that is needed to form a conclusion against that policy. At the lowest level a citizen will provide information to find the answer to the following question:\n\n> Do I need to pay any inheritance tax on this person’s “estate”?\n\nWhile there are government needs (it is *a tax*), the citizen’s – the user’s – needs are at the centre of the work we do. We want to make sure the digital service we create is accessible, is usable by the general public. And we need to make sure the information we collect is stored securely and is the right information for HMRC.\n\nThat last point - that we provide the right information for HMRC - has come through as a strong user need during our research. Users want to make sure they provide the right information to HMRC the first time. They want to make sure they get it right, for themselves, for the deceased, for anyone else.\n\n####8\nAt its simplest level inheritance tax needs the user to provide information about the deceased’s *assets*, *debts*, and *any gifts the deceased has given away*.\n\nAs we have it in the service at the moment:\n\n* An asset is anything the deceased owned that has a value.\n\n* A debt is anything owed by the deceased.\n\n* A gift is anything given away by the estate. \n\nThere are different types of asset, debt, and gift.\n\nWe have designed the service so the user can provide information as simply as possible. In many cases we employ a simple ask a question and get a “Yes” and “No” response. And we provide supplemental and guiding information wherever we can, to aid the user.\n\nThe information provided by the user allows the service (and therefore HMRC) to reach a conclusion – which you might remember is “Do I need to pay any inheritance tax on this?” \n\n####9\nThe assets and debts parts of the online service are in a position where we feel we can push the service into ‘beta’. Beta means we would make the service available online so the public can use the service – and by using it helping us understand user needs even more, so we can adapt the service to meet those needs. (Because we’re driven by research.)\n\n####10\nGifts are not so easy to explain and understand. Recently we have been spending a lot of time in user sessions looking to find out how we can explain to users gifts in a way that isn’t hard. We have been spending time focused on this because previously the user response hasn’t been too positive.\n\nTo be fair, gifts is hard.\n\nFor the user research sessions we tend to provide the user with documents that mimic real life documents – such as bank statements, emails from relatives saying they received some money, a share certificate, and so on. We then ask the users to review those documents and show and tell us how they would extract information for the inheritance tax online service.\n\n####11\nThe week before last we reviewed the previous user sessions and found that when presented with an example of an inheritance tax our participants were taking the figures provided and *working backwards* to see how those figure were arrived at.\n\nIt was fascinating. Our users said they wanted to be sure they were working their figures out correctly and the examples illustrated  a correct way. Our users also found that understanding gifts was *hard*.\n\nWe also had user feedback about the tone of the language, with suggestions there was a lot, it was “the usual government tone”, and it could do with being “more human”.\n\n####12\nBecause user research sessions are about exploring we decided we would use the Friday to pull together a prototype that provides several pages of simple, clear explanations of “gifts”, written in a slightly more informal tone. These pages would come before the user enters any gift information.\n\nA prototype is something that tests an idea. (I have [blogged about this before](/a-short-note-about-prototyping/).) The prototype we looked to make is a \"fake\" version of the service that users could use in a web browser, as if it was the real thing.\n\nAlthough we moved quickly to make this prototype, as a team – myself, Andy the content designer, and Sara our user researcher – we huddled and worked nimbly, first sketching out some wireframes, understanding what content we need, how we will divide it, and then setting to work on making this around my Macbook.\n\nI code using the [GDS prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit) using our sketches as reference, while Andy pulls together the copy we need as content. Sara, as always, keeps us on track making sure we meet user needs, as well as helping shape some of the detail of the upcoming research sessions. \n\nOn Saturday I took a couple of hours to review the work (always good to sleep on something new), and did a couple of tweaks.\n\nSunday morning, thanks to people's generosity, I did some pop-up research near where I live to see how the tone and size of the pages felt. If there were any issues from this quick Sunday session we could resolve anything major on Monday as part of our team review ahead of the day of user research on Tuesday.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/10/iht-pop-up-research.jpg)\n*Doing some pop-up research with the prototype*\n\nSunday was a quick five minutes each with four people, and half an hour in-depth with one person. Tuesday we went into the user research sessions looking for more focused, more detailed user response – each session was 90 minutes, one on one in a room at a computer, listening and watching the users interact with the fake service we’d pulled together. It’s always fascinating seeing how our manifested theories act as stimulus, whether the response backs up our approach or not.\n\n####13\nThe outcome to Tuesday’s sessions was really favourable.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/10/iht-prototype-grabs.jpg)\n*Examples pages from the prototype created*\n\nUsers found the “mini manual” pages effective, helped them understand, albeit not completely. Several users told us if they were doing this application for real they would actually print off one of the pages, take it away to read in their own time, so they could understand – and know they understood.\n\nThis was a really unexpected response but one that made sense. We had divided a lot of bulky information into smaller pages, and altered the tone. Once it got to the page where the user *really* needed to understand some new concepts this made sense. And printing it off made sense as well, especially given the large amount of “desk work” required by any inheritance tax application.\n\nThe person filling in the inheritance tax application online will receive information in emails electronically, on letters through the post, from phone calls and their own written notes. There is no escaping that at this moment in time. It made us super-aware we need to make sure the pages print alright!\n\n####14\nWhat didn’t work so well? While we made in-roads on gifts, users need further help to understand *exemptions* that can be applied to gifts. Users struggled here – and we know that this is an issue with the wider service. We could use this as our cue for What To Do Next.\n\nOverall, we could view our research sessions as a \"success\". They showed we were moving in the right direction, and also helped us guide where to concentrate next.\n\n####15\nEarlier this week we had a workshop exploring how we can make the process for the user simpler. We immersed ourselves in the full service, and put ourselves in the eventual users’ shoes.\n\nWhere would they get this information, where would they find out what to get, how would they build it up, how would they split it up, how would they “record” what the figures were, and so on.\n\nWe have some ideas which we need to put in front of users, see how they respond. Because, at the end of the day, it’s not about what I think is right, or anyone else in the team thinks is right – it what is right for our users, it is what works for our users.\n\n####16\nWe’ll be continuing to research this in the coming couple of weeks. Hopefully I will be able to update you in the near future on how we get on. \n\n####Footnotes\nIf you want to read more on how we design in government there's a great post by Rebecca Cottrell [on the GDS design notes blog](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/13/how-designers-prototype-at-gds/).","html":"<h4 id=\"1\">1</h4>\n\n<p>At HMRC Digital we look to put user needs first, designing and creating digital services that are shaped around what works for users of the services.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2\">2</h4>\n\n<p>Three weeks into my time at HMRC Digital I wrote about working in a team in government, which you can <a href=\"/hmrc-nearly-three-weeks-up/\">read here</a>. I dealt in broad strokes previously.</p>\n\n<p>Now approaching three months on the job, I thought it might be useful to explore how we are approaching creating the inheritance tax digital online service with a user first approach.</p>\n\n<p>I joined the project a couple of months back and the team had already done some sterling work creating theoretical design approaches, going through these with users in research sessions, and adapting our work based on those responses. As design approaches are approved by users our developers create the digital service.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3\">3</h4>\n\n<p>Inheritance tax itself is hard. I compare it to papier mâché.</p>\n\n<p>The original rules were created. Think of them as the first layer, neat, and on recorded on paper. And as time has passed and little bits have been stuck on top, more and more little bits responding to situations, scenarios, where the rules have had to be created or changed. Inheritance tax is not alone on this. A lot of British policy and law is like this. It adapts to circumstances. This means though that this is hard.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"4\">4</h4>\n\n<p>Creating the ability for citizens to submit inheritance tax information online is a long process. To help us bring the digital inheritance tax online we are carrying out two phases of work: one this year (2015), the second next year (2016). It is a big programme.</p>\n\n<p>(And remember laws and policy are always capable of change.)</p>\n\n<p>This year’s work is focused on bringing online what is currently centred around the <em>205 inheritance tax paper form</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What this means as simple as possible: Anyone who fills in a 205 form and while doing that isn’t at any point directed away to any other inheritance tax form doesn’t have any inheritance tax to pay. A lot of the work being doing in this first phase is groundwork for any later phases.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"5\">5</h4>\n\n<p>Research is important to the way we work.</p>\n\n<p>We want to <em>know</em>. As we work in government we have a lot of great insight to draw upon, and we work closely with the inheritance tax teams within government who have a lot of experience and knowledge. We also talk with our colleagues in other government agencies, including DWP and GDS.</p>\n\n<p>If we don’t know, we care, we want to find out, digging deeper. There are plenty of ways we can get this understanding.</p>\n\n<p>If we don’t get answers we will be working with assumptions, which is not a preferred way of designing and making.</p>\n\n<p>If we <em>have to</em> work with an assumption to keep our work going, we look to validate (prove/disprove) that assumption as soon as we can, in the most appropriate way. Slight correction: We <em>make sure</em> we validate that assumption.</p>\n\n<p>We do – after all – work with user needs.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"6\">6</h4>\n\n<p>From research we know that the majority of people who fill in the current paper based 205 form will be doing this as a relative of someone has passed away.</p>\n\n<p>Collecting and organising this information is not the easiest process. This is amplified if you are looking to submit inheritance tax information for a close family member.</p>\n\n<p>It is our goal to <em>make submitting the inheritance tax information as painless as we can</em>. We know it is not easy for the user for emotional reasons.</p>\n\n<p>We also know collecting the information that is needed is not easy. It can take time to find. It can take time to look through. And it can take time to understand what exactly is needed for inheritance tax.</p>\n\n<p>We don’t want to make it any harder. If anything, we want to make it easier.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"7\">7</h4>\n\n<p>Inheritance tax is policy driven: government has its needs. This, for the most part, means we need to acquire information that is needed to form a conclusion against that policy. At the lowest level a citizen will provide information to find the answer to the following question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do I need to pay any inheritance tax on this person’s “estate”?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While there are government needs (it is <em>a tax</em>), the citizen’s – the user’s – needs are at the centre of the work we do. We want to make sure the digital service we create is accessible, is usable by the general public. And we need to make sure the information we collect is stored securely and is the right information for HMRC.</p>\n\n<p>That last point - that we provide the right information for HMRC - has come through as a strong user need during our research. Users want to make sure they provide the right information to HMRC the first time. They want to make sure they get it right, for themselves, for the deceased, for anyone else.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"8\">8</h4>\n\n<p>At its simplest level inheritance tax needs the user to provide information about the deceased’s <em>assets</em>, <em>debts</em>, and <em>any gifts the deceased has given away</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As we have it in the service at the moment:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>An asset is anything the deceased owned that has a value.</p></li>\n<li><p>A debt is anything owed by the deceased.</p></li>\n<li><p>A gift is anything given away by the estate. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are different types of asset, debt, and gift.</p>\n\n<p>We have designed the service so the user can provide information as simply as possible. In many cases we employ a simple ask a question and get a “Yes” and “No” response. And we provide supplemental and guiding information wherever we can, to aid the user.</p>\n\n<p>The information provided by the user allows the service (and therefore HMRC) to reach a conclusion – which you might remember is “Do I need to pay any inheritance tax on this?” </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"9\">9</h4>\n\n<p>The assets and debts parts of the online service are in a position where we feel we can push the service into ‘beta’. Beta means we would make the service available online so the public can use the service – and by using it helping us understand user needs even more, so we can adapt the service to meet those needs. (Because we’re driven by research.)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"10\">10</h4>\n\n<p>Gifts are not so easy to explain and understand. Recently we have been spending a lot of time in user sessions looking to find out how we can explain to users gifts in a way that isn’t hard. We have been spending time focused on this because previously the user response hasn’t been too positive.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, gifts is hard.</p>\n\n<p>For the user research sessions we tend to provide the user with documents that mimic real life documents – such as bank statements, emails from relatives saying they received some money, a share certificate, and so on. We then ask the users to review those documents and show and tell us how they would extract information for the inheritance tax online service.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"11\">11</h4>\n\n<p>The week before last we reviewed the previous user sessions and found that when presented with an example of an inheritance tax our participants were taking the figures provided and <em>working backwards</em> to see how those figure were arrived at.</p>\n\n<p>It was fascinating. Our users said they wanted to be sure they were working their figures out correctly and the examples illustrated  a correct way. Our users also found that understanding gifts was <em>hard</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We also had user feedback about the tone of the language, with suggestions there was a lot, it was “the usual government tone”, and it could do with being “more human”.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"12\">12</h4>\n\n<p>Because user research sessions are about exploring we decided we would use the Friday to pull together a prototype that provides several pages of simple, clear explanations of “gifts”, written in a slightly more informal tone. These pages would come before the user enters any gift information.</p>\n\n<p>A prototype is something that tests an idea. (I have <a href=\"/a-short-note-about-prototyping/\">blogged about this before</a>.) The prototype we looked to make is a \"fake\" version of the service that users could use in a web browser, as if it was the real thing.</p>\n\n<p>Although we moved quickly to make this prototype, as a team – myself, Andy the content designer, and Sara our user researcher – we huddled and worked nimbly, first sketching out some wireframes, understanding what content we need, how we will divide it, and then setting to work on making this around my Macbook.</p>\n\n<p>I code using the <a href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit\">GDS prototype kit</a> using our sketches as reference, while Andy pulls together the copy we need as content.

It's informed. It's easy to access to crib from. It helps us get up and running. It helps us get on with the work.\n\nThe pay-off: There's also limits in what we do at work. Do not misread this: The work I do is fun, a certain kind of fun.\n\nEveryone likes to cut loose once in a while, especially when you're working off a design platform on digitalising government services.\n\n####2\nToday some of the HMRC Digital team left work after their day's work, and headed off for a little design session.\n\nGDS have their own stickers (have a look at Ben Terrett's [first Mac at GDS](https://www.flickr.com/photos/benterrett/11209009683)). We thought it'd be fun, even cool to have a go at thinking about, designing some stickers from the work we do. It was also a great chance to think about design outside the platforms and services we focus on daily.\n\nIn an hour, we talked, scribbled, explored ideas around where we work.\n\nHMRC is a rich hive for \"topics\" associated with it.\n\nThere's the language of finance. It can be technical. It can be daunting. But what about more popular references to that?\n\n![Super Mario Bros](/content/images/2015/11/super-mario-bros.jpg)\n\nThere's the form numbers – which is a government love – and what they mean. Some of them tie into life events, such as leaving a job, with the infamous P45 most widely known.\n\nThere's the way we work: agile, by listening. Could we celebrate, say, a novice building their first prototype in-browser?\n\nThere's the challenges creating digital services, the benefits of what digital services can bring, the improvements that can happen, [constantly in the public eye](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/hmrc-fails-to-answer-thousands-of-tax-credit-calls).\n\nWe delved into looking at the more public faces of HMRC in the past - [Hector the Inspector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_the_Tax_Inspector), [Moira Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQewKiBQlU).\n\nWe also had a look into the places leading the creation of HMRC's digital services: Newcastle, London, Telford, and Shipley. What makes them stand out. A sample of Newcastle: the bridges, Jimmy Nail, Viz, the football team, [Charles Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grey,_2nd_Earl_Grey), [Joseph Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cowen).\n\n(Note: We really need a great bridge in Shipley to help us do a series of bridge based stickers for each location. Not quite sure the one on Otley Road over the canal will do the job.)\n\n![](/content/images/2015/11/stickers-draft.jpg)\n\nIn an hour we got through so much, pulled together some rough ideas, sketching ideas on paper and in Keynote. We decided we'd get three or four ideas into three pots: \"locales\"; \"recognition (of success) / motivation\"; and \"slogans/straplines\". And we thought through what would be appropriate, in tone of the stickers themselves and how you could get a sticker (which could we just give away? which would need to be \"earned\"?).\n\nWe'll be taking our ideas back to the wider HMRC Digital team – not just the design team – and get their input, what they like/dislike, and see if there any other needs. Working with our wider colleagues is a big part of what we do, cooperation is key.\n\n####3\nThe biggest takeaway: It's easy to have your head down at work. Just getting away from work, to talk about our work with a specific productive goal, in a more open manner is something we should all do more.\n\nWhether you think stickers are cool or daft, it gave us that focus to talk, to create with purpose.\n\nIt wasn't just a case of getting out once in a while to [look around you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzvz1j3h4Xk) – but to get out once in a while, to get out of the bubble, and *do something*.\n\nAnd we had fun doing it.\n\n*ps. In case you're here looking for an example of taxpayers money being wasted, we'll be continuing this work in our own time and paying for the stickers ourselves.*","html":"<h4 id=\"1\">1</h4>\n\n<p>Working on creating HMRC's digital services there's great benefits using GDS's work as a platform (<a href=\"http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/gds-as-a-platform/\">blogged about previously here</a>).

But what about more popular references to that?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/11/super-mario-bros.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Bros\" /></p>\n\n<p>There's the form numbers – which is a government love – and what they mean. Some of them tie into life events, such as leaving a job, with the infamous P45 most widely known.</p>\n\n<p>There's the way we work: agile, by listening. Could we celebrate, say, a novice building their first prototype in-browser?</p>\n\n<p>There's the challenges creating digital services, the benefits of what digital services can bring, the improvements that can happen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/hmrc-fails-to-answer-thousands-of-tax-credit-calls\">constantly in the public eye</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We delved into looking at the more public faces of HMRC in the past - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_the_Tax_Inspector\">Hector the Inspector</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQewKiBQlU\">Moira Stewart</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We also had a look into the places leading the creation of HMRC's digital services: Newcastle, London, Telford, and Shipley. What makes them stand out. A sample of Newcastle: the bridges, Jimmy Nail, Viz, the football team, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grey,_2nd_Earl_Grey\">Charles Grey</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cowen\">Joseph Cowen</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: We really need a great bridge in Shipley to help us do a series of bridge based stickers for each location. Not quite sure the one on Otley Road over the canal will do the job.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/11/stickers-draft.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>In an hour we got through so much, pulled together some rough ideas, sketching ideas on paper and in Keynote. We decided we'd get three or four ideas into three pots: \"locales\"; \"recognition (of success) / motivation\"; and \"slogans/straplines\". And we thought through what would be appropriate, in tone of the stickers themselves and how you could get a sticker (which could we just give away? which would need to be \"earned\"?).</p>\n\n<p>We'll be taking our ideas back to the wider HMRC Digital team – not just the design team – and get their input, what they like/dislike, and see if there any other needs. Working with our wider colleagues is a big part of what we do, cooperation is key.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3\">3</h4>\n\n<p>The biggest takeaway: It's easy to have your head down at work. Just getting away from work, to talk about our work with a specific productive goal, in a more open manner is something we should all do more.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you think stickers are cool or daft, it gave us that focus to talk, to create with purpose.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn't just a case of getting out once in a while to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzvz1j3h4Xk\">look around you</a> – but to get out once in a while, to get out of the bubble, and <em>do something</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And we had fun doing it.</p>\n\n<p><em>ps. In case you're here looking for an example of taxpayers money being wasted, we'll be continuing this work in our own time and paying for the stickers ourselves.</em></p>","image":"/content/images/2015/11/stickers-workshop.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-18T08:12:48.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-18T10:04:22.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-11-17T21:50:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":108,"uuid":"ea41161a-2011-4e52-83b3-a13b98a20feb","title":"Forefront, Leeds, 25 November 2015","slug":"forefront-leeds-26-november-2015","markdown":"It was a privilege to be asked to speak at [Forefront Leeds](forefront.cc/forefront-no9-november-25th-at-the-belgrave/) last night – almost a year on from when [I last talked at the event](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/).\n\nIt's never a problem to support the work [Russ Poulter](https://twitter.com/russpoulter) and [Chris Kemm](https://twitter.com/chriskemm) put into pulling the event together by saying yes to their invites, putting the time in to write a talk, and then deliver it on the night – especially alongside two other engrossing talks from [Alex](https://twitter.com/webbist) and [Becs](https://twitter.com/becskr).

But we always seem to get little peaks of some or all of the above. So, we are always thankful that people are willing to take part in our sessions. We never take that for granted.\n\nWhile as a government bodies we are [digital by default](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default), we cannot forget those who need assistance not just digital but interfacing with government. This is why we work towards ensuring there is [assisted digital support](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/index.html).\n\nIn a recent user research session we were lucky to have – for me – one of the bravest participants in our sessions.\n\nWe spend a lot of time in our research sessions with people who are over 55.\n\nWe have spent time with many that are incredibly comfortable with using computers, laptops, tablets, and touchscreen mobile phones. We spend time with people who just use desktop computers. And we’ve spent time with older people who only use a tablet and a touchscreen mobile phone. And we have spent time with many who are less comfortable with digital devices, but can get by.\n\nUntil recently I had not spent time in our sessions with someone who could not use a computer. Just re-read that sentence. We are working on “digitalising” the inheritance tax service. When we ask people to come and work with us, we are up front about this. So, for a change, we added onto our request for help by saying “If you do not use computers or have never used a computer we need your help, we *want* you to help us.”\n\nA lady came to our most recent session to help us.\n\nShe was nervous.\n\nShe sat with me and told me she understood what computers could do, that she thought they were “amazing”, but she didn’t understand them, she couldn’t use them.\n\nIf she ever needed to do something on a computer she got one of her sons to do it. Sometimes she watched, but mostly she rang one of her sons.\n\nBut she wanted to help, she wanted to learn. She was really clever, quick, understood the paperwork we went through with her to explain inheritance tax, and quickly became attuned to the fake documents we were using to help file a fake inheritance tax estate.\n\nAs I type this I am doing something that she was nervous doing herself. Typing was an unknown for her. She just didn’t do it. She just didn’t do this thing many of us just *do*.\n\nThis meant we had to assist her. We sat on the computer, and went through our service on screen, asking her the questions that came up on screen, clicking or typing a response and showing her on screen.\n\nAt one point the lady told me a value which I typed.\n\n“Hmmm.”\n\nShe looked at the piece of paper in her hands.\n\n“Hmmmmm.”\n\nShe went to the other papers, and started to look through them.\n\n“I think that’s right, but I am just checking.”\n\nShe found the other piece of paper she was looking for, and calmly scanned it. She went back to the original piece of paper.\n\n“I thought it was right, but I’ve just looked. I got it wrong. It’s this value. But we have already put something into the computer.”\n\n“We can change it, it’s fine, it’s easy,” I told the lady.\n\n“It’s easy for *you*,” she reminded me.\n\nYes, she was right.\n\nSo I showed her what I meant by “easy”.\n\nI moved the pointer up the screen to the box. I clicked on it, and I told her “If I press this key it will remove that number you gave me before. We’ll then have a blank box again. It’s like using an eraser. It’s not going to break anything. And we will type in the new number.”\n\nThe lady nodded. Her earlier nervousness seemed to have gone. She told me the number and I typed it in.\n\n“That’s what I meant by it being easy. We can just go back and correct it.”\n\n“It does look easy,” the lady told me.\n\nA couple of screens later, the lady had to do a little digging to find the value needed.\n\n“Ah!”\n\nShe had found it.\n\nI asked her if she wanted to try typing it. \n\n“Remember, this is a fake website. It doesn’t save this information. You can’t break it.”\n\n“Can I?” the lady asked.\n\n“You just need to press this key once. Just tap it.”\n\nShe slowly leant over and tapped the key. She peered up and saw the number on screen.\n\n“Do you want to do the next number?”\n\nShe pressed zero.\n\nShe pressed zero again.\n\n“That’s all the numbers for that,” she confirmed. And she sat back into her usual straight position, and laughed. “Oooo, that was nervous!”\n\nA little later I asked if she wanted to enter another value. Again, she leant over, less nervously, and with patient assurance pressed the four numbers needed.\n\nShe smiled this time, and did a little nod. She'd done good.\n\n“Maybe I will do the typing instead of my sons next time!”\n\nBy the end of the session this lady had also perfectly extracted the information from the documents for us to put into the service. She'd been so brave to even be there and do the stuff while she was there. She'd been brilliant.\n\nAll the people who help us with research to shape government services, not just inheritance tax, are brave. They are there to test our knowledge, remind us of things, and teach us new things. And once in a while we get to teach those people something new.","html":"<p>We are always thankful to the time people give up to help us in user research sessions.

You can read why in the long version below.\n\nI am making the lessons openly available.\n\n**<a name=\"lessons\"></a>The lessons**\n\n* [View the Github repo](https://github.com/ermlikeyeah/HMRC-Git-lessons)\n\n**The first lesson**\n\n* [View as PDF - 3.38Mb](https://github.com/ermlikeyeah/HMRC-Git-lessons/blob/master/hmrc%20digital%20-%20get%20git%20-%20lesson%201.pdf)\n* [View a repo of a web-friendly version](https://github.com/ermlikeyeah/HMRC-Git-lessons/tree/master/lesson1), created by [Zuz](http://www.twitter.com/techforevil)\n(Note: Will push this to Heroku at some point soon so all can just view it.)\n\n\n\n####The long version\n\"What is Git?\"\n\n\"I don't know Git.\"\n\n\"Should I be using Git?\"\n\n\"Why should I be using Git?\"\n\n\"I think I know Git. I *think*.\"\n\nSome days I fall into that last bracket.\n\nI am a little \"Am I doing this right? I've just always done it this way.\"\n\nBefore I go any further: Git. Don't worry. We're not talking about being a nasty person. We're taking about [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)), a piece of software that allows us to create, store, and recall versions of software.\n\nAnyway, I've never checked if I *know* Git. And I've been using Git for a long time now, six years, maybe seven years.\n\nAbout the time I started using Git, making web-based stuff was something I'd moved away from in my day job. I tinkered in evenings to keep the skills alive. Git is one of those things (seemingly like all the things I've learnt to do with making things for the internet) I learnt by doing a little reading on the web, and then just using and doing. I didn't go on a course. I didn't take lessons. \n\nSo when I heard some people at work saying some of the stuff above it sparked a thought: Do *I* know Git?\n\nI spent a lunchtime going through a couple of online tutorials. It was alright. It's OK. Relax, Si. You've been doing Git just fine.\n\nWhich is handy. Git is a part of the way we store and share work within government, so it's important as makers of things we understand how it works.\n\nAnother part of how we work in government is about people - we put users first, but we're also about collaboration. \n\nAnd some of my colleagues were saying that stuff above.\n\nI emailed round some of the other designers in HMRC with a \"Hey guys! Would you be interested in learning about Git?\"\n\nThe tone was important. It was about inclusion, not exclusion. We'll learn in a safe space. There's no shame in saying you don't know. Reply to me if you know nothing, if you're unsure, or if you're a Git pro who wants to help out. All welcome.\n\nAnd importantly, this wasn't a persuasional, political piece. This wasn't going to tell people they should use Git, that Git is the best. Just a quick intro to why *we use Git*, and how to use Git.\n\nI got a few replies from potential students.\n\nA coder on the service I help make had already pulled together a great intro to Git which he shared. There was some great stuff in there, although maybe too hardcore for an intro to the uninitiated, but some good stuff to draw on.\n\nI pulled the \"lower level\" stuff out, mixed in some of my own stuff, and met with some of those interested in helping me shape a session.\n\nWe talked through how a good lesson would work for us, what are the essentials of Git, came to a consensus. We prototyped the lesson using a whiteboard, going through several versions, all in half an hour. I was keen the \"students\" learnt by doing, like a practical at school. And acting through the lesson we saw that it wasn't just one lesson we'd need.\n\nIn spare moments here and there over the next week - at the back in meetings, on train journeys - I pulled together the lesson, and then ran through it critically with the \"adjudicators\", made some adjustments.\n\nWe set up the first lesson, invited all, but made them aware this first lesson is us testing the lesson in the open.\n\nAnd it went alright. We found what we always learnt with making things: Running through *the actual thing we made* with other people provided some unexpected results.\n\n(This is why I say *test the test*.)\n\nWe learnt from that first lesson, cut it shorter, made a couple of changes to the flow of the lesson, some edits to the content, and ran the lesson again.\n\nAgain we learnt a couple of things, so again tweaked and ran the lesson again.\n\nAfter the third run-through we're just about \"there\".

I <em>think</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Some days I fall into that last bracket.</p>\n\n<p>I am a little \"Am I doing this right? I've just always done it this way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Before I go any further: Git. Don't worry. We're not talking about being a nasty person. We're taking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)\">Git</a>, a piece of software that allows us to create, store, and recall versions of software.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I've never checked if I <em>know</em> Git. And I've been using Git for a long time now, six years, maybe seven years.</p>\n\n<p>About the time I started using Git, making web-based stuff was something I'd moved away from in my day job. I tinkered in evenings to keep the skills alive. Git is one of those things (seemingly like all the things I've learnt to do with making things for the internet) I learnt by doing a little reading on the web, and then just using and doing. I didn't go on a course. I didn't take lessons. </p>\n\n<p>So when I heard some people at work saying some of the stuff above it sparked a thought: Do <em>I</em> know Git?</p>\n\n<p>I spent a lunchtime going through a couple of online tutorials. It was alright. It's OK. Relax, Si. You've been doing Git just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Which is handy. Git is a part of the way we store and share work within government, so it's important as makers of things we understand how it works.</p>\n\n<p>Another part of how we work in government is about people - we put users first, but we're also about collaboration. </p>\n\n<p>And some of my colleagues were saying that stuff above.</p>\n\n<p>I emailed round some of the other designers in HMRC with a \"Hey guys! Would you be interested in learning about Git?\"</p>\n\n<p>The tone was important. It was about inclusion, not exclusion. We'll learn in a safe space. There's no shame in saying you don't know. Reply to me if you know nothing, if you're unsure, or if you're a Git pro who wants to help out. All welcome.</p>\n\n<p>And importantly, this wasn't a persuasional, political piece. This wasn't going to tell people they should use Git, that Git is the best. Just a quick intro to why <em>we use Git</em>, and how to use Git.</p>\n\n<p>I got a few replies from potential students.</p>\n\n<p>A coder on the service I help make had already pulled together a great intro to Git which he shared. There was some great stuff in there, although maybe too hardcore for an intro to the uninitiated, but some good stuff to draw on.</p>\n\n<p>I pulled the \"lower level\" stuff out, mixed in some of my own stuff, and met with some of those interested in helping me shape a session.</p>\n\n<p>We talked through how a good lesson would work for us, what are the essentials of Git, came to a consensus. We prototyped the lesson using a whiteboard, going through several versions, all in half an hour. I was keen the \"students\" learnt by doing, like a practical at school. And acting through the lesson we saw that it wasn't just one lesson we'd need.</p>\n\n<p>In spare moments here and there over the next week - at the back in meetings, on train journeys - I pulled together the lesson, and then ran through it critically with the \"adjudicators\", made some adjustments.</p>\n\n<p>We set up the first lesson, invited all, but made them aware this first lesson is us testing the lesson in the open.</p>\n\n<p>And it went alright. We found what we always learnt with making things: Running through <em>the actual thing we made</em> with other people provided some unexpected results.</p>\n\n<p>(This is why I say <em>test the test</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>We learnt from that first lesson, cut it shorter, made a couple of changes to the flow of the lesson, some edits to the content, and ran the lesson again.</p>\n\n<p>Again we learnt a couple of things, so again tweaked and ran the lesson again.</p>\n\n<p>After the third run-through we're just about \"there\". And we want to share that first lesson with you. You might find it useful for your own lessons.

To be more precise I owe a lot due to my time at one agency: [Brahm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Agency). You can [view the slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/idlesi/forefront-november-2015?slide=38), 38 onwards.\n\nOne thing my slides don’t spell out is I owe my career on *the advertising side* a lot. In short: I started at Brahm on the digital side, and moved to the ad/design side about a third of the way through my time there. And I am perfectly cool saying that as well. Hipster digital types may smirk, but whatever.\n\nI learnt more about “find the right thing” than being on the “digital side”. The process on the ad side was similar to the digital department; we just didn't lose hours realising in Photoshop or Fireworks anywhere near as much, and it was more collaborative.\n\nWorking to come up with the core ideas, with pen and paper, throw things away, talk critically about the work within the team, refine what we’d done, throw more stuff away, and on it went. By being faster, by being iterative. \n\nHowever we did it, one goal: Know what we are looking to achieve, through knowing we have to hone in on the one thing that works.\n\nMy time at Brahm also taught me to *know the process* and *believe in the process* - and also *keep adapting the process*, short term per job, long term across the teams.\n\nThere is a key part of that process I think gets neglected in the rush to [JFDI](http://geekdictionary.computing.net/define/jfdi).\n\n####2\nI’ve said before that [a brief](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/tag/briefs/) is the most important document for any agency job – or at least the process of what goes into a good brief. The best briefs – or “briefs” – are driven by *research*, carry *analysis*, set down an *understanding*, reveals *motivations*, *goals*, and shared. It is an agreement on cross-levels.\n\nHowever, it *is* the thing that comes first, a point of reference. It kicks everything off. Everything after that relies on it. Asking, finding out, knowing at the beginning means we know how we are getting along, something to look back against. The brief can adapt as time goes on, but always there.\n\nIn the world of creating products and services, the prevalent Agile is used an excuse to miss this discovery phase out. We still need to learn, we still need to understand *Why?* we need to do the work. Being ‘agile’ isn't an excuse to jump past this, to fly in feet first. ‘Agile’ isn't about that. Missing out that discovery isn't how agile works.\n\nThere needs to be *more thinking like a start-up*, a good start-up. A good start-up recognises there is a *need*. They do their research, they analyse, they focus. They might not luxuriate in it, but they recognise a solid need. The best start-ups then deliver something that meets that need.\n\nAnother important point: Start-ups don’t have all the time in the world. More need to get something out there fast, so move nimbly, explore, throw stuff away, hone in, do their exploration in the open by shipping regularly, building around/up.\n\nThey *need to get something out that works* so they can something back in – be it insight, product exposure, or even revenue – and it will only work if they’ve dedicated time to getting some degree of *knowing*. Their product, their business, their jobs depend upon it.\n\nEverything you do – agile-styled or however – is pointless if the thing you work on has no point. It's better to throw something away when you have discovered that early on than too far down the line.","html":"<h4 id=\"1\">1</h4>\n\n<p>A month or so back during <a href=\"http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-26-november-2015/\">my talk at Forefront</a> I mentioned I owe a lot due to my time in agencies.

You can <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/idlesi/forefront-november-2015?slide=38\">view the slides here</a>, 38 onwards.</p>\n\n<p>One thing my slides don’t spell out is I owe my career on <em>the advertising side</em> a lot. In short: I started at Brahm on the digital side, and moved to the ad/design side about a third of the way through my time there. And I am perfectly cool saying that as well. Hipster digital types may smirk, but whatever.</p>\n\n<p>I learnt more about “find the right thing” than being on the “digital side”. The process on the ad side was similar to the digital department; we just didn't lose hours realising in Photoshop or Fireworks anywhere near as much, and it was more collaborative.</p>\n\n<p>Working to come up with the core ideas, with pen and paper, throw things away, talk critically about the work within the team, refine what we’d done, throw more stuff away, and on it went. By being faster, by being iterative. </p>\n\n<p>However we did it, one goal: Know what we are looking to achieve, through knowing we have to hone in on the one thing that works.</p>\n\n<p>My time at Brahm also taught me to <em>know the process</em> and <em>believe in the process</em> - and also <em>keep adapting the process</em>, short term per job, long term across the teams.</p>\n\n<p>There is a key part of that process I think gets neglected in the rush to <a href=\"http://geekdictionary.computing.net/define/jfdi\">JFDI</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2\">2</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve said before that <a href=\"http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/tag/briefs/\">a brief</a> is the most important document for any agency job – or at least the process of what goes into a good brief. The best briefs – or “briefs” – are driven by <em>research</em>, carry <em>analysis</em>, set down an <em>understanding</em>, reveals <em>motivations</em>, <em>goals</em>, and shared. It is an agreement on cross-levels.</p>\n\n<p>However, it <em>is</em> the thing that comes first, a point of reference. It kicks everything off. Everything after that relies on it. Asking, finding out, knowing at the beginning means we know how we are getting along, something to look back against. The brief can adapt as time goes on, but always there.</p>\n\n<p>In the world of creating products and services, the prevalent Agile is used an excuse to miss this discovery phase out. We still need to learn, we still need to understand <em>Why?</em> we need to do the work. Being ‘agile’ isn't an excuse to jump past this, to fly in feet first. ‘Agile’ isn't about that. Missing out that discovery isn't how agile works.</p>\n\n<p>There needs to be <em>more thinking like a start-up</em>, a good start-up. A good start-up recognises there is a <em>need</em>. They do their research, they analyse, they focus. They might not luxuriate in it, but they recognise a solid need. The best start-ups then deliver something that meets that need.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point: Start-ups don’t have all the time in the world. More need to get something out there fast, so move nimbly, explore, throw stuff away, hone in, do their exploration in the open by shipping regularly, building around/up.</p>\n\n<p>They <em>need to get something out that works</em> so they can something back in – be it insight, product exposure, or even revenue – and it will only work if they’ve dedicated time to getting some degree of <em>knowing</em>. Their product, their business, their jobs depend upon it.</p>\n\n<p>Everything you do – agile-styled or however – is pointless if the thing you work on has no point. It's better to throw something away when you have discovered that early on than too far down the line.</p>","image":"/content/images/2015/12/weird-science.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-12-22T08:05:56.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-12-29T11:40:57.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2015-12-22T09:32:40.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":115,"uuid":"65debd2a-dc0e-41e1-95f1-a12fcd5a49bc","title":"Coffee and toast","slug":"coffee-and-toast","markdown":"A week or so back I was in a pal’s “backyard”. My friend works at a place doing that digital products/services thing. Some bloody good ones at that. It’d have been rude not to have a nosy round his workplace and catch up.\n\nIt hits lunchtime, it’s been a while so we’re having a good gas over coffee. He’s enjoying his work again, always good to see a talented mate in the groove of work and life, and he gets onto comparing it to his previous role in an “agency”, a “digital agency”. He “gets to spend months working on *just one thing* rather than jumping hour to hour from one thing to the next”. It’s a world of immersion, luxurious compared to what he’s experienced before. It’s good where he works: Good people, good work, good place.\n\nWe got ruminating about what we would called this sort of place. It’s not an agency. Maybe it’s a studio. A design business? A software house? Creative technology firm? We go on, and start to shudder and giggle at what we’re saying. We didn’t really come to a conclusion, we move on, comparing notes on how my mate’s place and where I work operate.\n\nI’ve posted before about working at [HMRC Digital](/tag/hmrc-digital/). A lot of how our places of work go about doing work: Comparable. Agile, sprints, exploring through prototypes, working “with the business”. They seem to have the edge getting something working out into the open faster, but something to work on. There’s breakout spaces, and big whiteboard wall surfaces you can draw on. And we’re nodding at how alike our “public” and “private” workplaces are.\n\nStop for a second there. Pretty amazing that, ways of working in the public and private sectors being alike.\n\nAnd then we get onto coffee. We’re in a coffee place. I am a recently converted liker of coffee after years of stubbornly avoiding it.\n\n“Man, we have fresh ground coffee delivered at work, lovely stuff, and percolators we can take to our desks. We have coffee rounds! And a wicked coffee machine if we have the time to wait for it to hiss a coffee out! We have really smart kitchens. Not over the top, just smart, maybe so we look after them.”\n\n“And mugs?” I ask.\n\n“Oh! The mugs in the cupboards are from Ikea. Small detail.” And he goes on. They’ve also got a table tennis table, a pool table, and other stuff. “It’s a nice place to go to, not just for work,” he concludes.\n\nI raise my eyebrows. “We don’t have any of those add-ons. But I wouldn’t expect table tennis and pool tables in the public sector. But we have to bring in our own coffee, even if it’s granules. And, or teabags. And a cup, or mug. And we don’t even have teaspoons. We might actually – if we do they’re either really scarce, or really well hidden. But I never see them, so I always have a teaspoon and emergency teabags in my backpack.”\n\nMy mate looks surprised. “No! Having them just sounds… *normal* to me. Don’t you miss those things?”\n\nYes, I do, but I suggest maybe it’s not normal, that all the places we’ve worked before, where they had mugs, teaspoons, teabags, coffee, all that being provided was abnormal compared to the rest of the working world, we just find it normal because that's our experience. I can hear my own doubt as I say it.\n\nMy mate confirms: “No.”\n\n“But!” my mate starts to point out, “The difference in what we do is you’re working on how we interact with government. I am not. We,” he says pointing between both of us, “don’t have a choice in how we do that. We are forced to do it the way set down. It must be great going to work every day. Isn’t not having those *normal things* the price to pay for getting to do that work?”\n\nI pause for a second. Is it? Is not having “normal” at work a price to pay for the kind of work I do? I don’t know. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. Those normal things would be paid for by the public. Would that be right? I can see why we have to provide our own. But for all the talk earlier in our chat about how alike my mate's workplace is and my workplace we find a big gap. And as we talk further we find other gaps, most of which feel like things that can be *sorted* or *made better*. (And I scribble those points down later.)\n\nI don't want this chat to end on a downer about working in the public sector. It is exciting, it is challenging (and sometimes avoidably), it is important, but this chat has unexpectedly explored compromises, the catching up still to happen, the boundaries of what is normal, what is grounded, what is expected at work, from work. Maybe there will always be a berth between making digital services in the public and private sectors. Should they be the same? But should one be at an disadvantage to the other? And reversibly at an advantage to the other?\n\nI am mindful of this, thinking of people who have done good work creating digitally enabled services in the public sector over the past several years to help it progress, fast, and have now gone (back) to the private sector. (And not just the Mike Brackens and Ben Terretts.) I hope the digital centred public sector won't be a place for people to just earn their spurs, then graduate from. I hope it will be a place of work that is comparable to non-public places of work, and retains the best people as much as possible. It needs good people, more good people.\n\nI try to lighten the mood. It is far from darkness, we're just standing in a shadowy corner of the conversation.\n\n“Have you heard about the [Tory councillor in Bradford kicking off about toasters](http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/14141401._They_will_never_take_our_toaster___Tories_declare_as_City_Hall_amnesty_starts_for_banned_electrical_appliances/) being banned in the city hall?

And again, buzzy buzzword time: Agile.\n\nThat’s why I thought it was worth making it clear this is *a programme*.

Sarah’s piece was about content, but it resonates a lot further with me. *Done is better than perfect* is also a great focus for the Thing You Are Making.\n\nI wrote before on [being more start-up](/weird-science/). I made a big edit to that piece just before I published it, looking back I wish I’d kept in. I originally noted we should treat our digital services more like start-ups. They’ve a runway with the clock ticking, their existence in the real world matters, get something solid, something done out – and keep working on it. Because making something and getting it out there in, say, just eight weeks isn't the end. It's just the start. Always be [in beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html). Always be releasing better.\n\nThis isn’t an excuse to to stick any old crap out. Which could be easy, because who else provides the services government compels you to use? There’s not competition there but that isn’t an excuse either. Society expects a government to provide.\n\nWe talk about how we work to make things simpler, clearer, faster. That shouldn’t just be the output of our work – it should be the way we work to get there. That's what programmes need.","html":"<p>Last week right along the top of a whiteboard I wrote something.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>THIS IS A PROGRAMME OF CHANGE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like that.

I made a big edit to that piece just before I published it, looking back I wish I’d kept in. I originally noted we should treat our digital services more like start-ups. They’ve a runway with the clock ticking, their existence in the real world matters, get something solid, something done out – and keep working on it. Because making something and getting it out there in, say, just eight weeks isn't the end. It's just the start. Always be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html\">in beta</a>. Always be releasing better.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t an excuse to to stick any old crap out. Which could be easy, because who else provides the services government compels you to use? There’s not competition there but that isn’t an excuse either. Society expects a government to provide.</p>\n\n<p>We talk about how we work to make things simpler, clearer, faster. That shouldn’t just be the output of our work – it should be the way we work to get there.

Rarely I drive up. Mostly I get the train. I like trains: the chauffeur experience, the chance to stare out of the window, the chance to read and write, the “Will I get a seat?” gamble. We’ve a pretty good rail network. What about the system that runs the network?\n\nSometimes I book the ticket in advance, using the Trainline.com’s app.\n\nMy user journey and needs are pretty straightforward.\n\n> I am travelling from Shipley to Newcastle. I will be coming back at some point in the next few days - I am not sure when, so let’s keep that open. I want to [leave at/arrive by] this time on that day. Show me the tickets I can choose from.\n\nMy options for leaving are always between 6am and 7:30am. Invariably I go for the cheapest option against the times presented. An *off-peak return for about £60*.\n\nSometimes I turn up to the train station without pre-booking a ticket. My user need when I have turned up at a train station without a pre-booked ticket (which is pretty regularly) is pretty straightforward.\n\n> I am travelling from Shipley to Newcastle. I have turned up to travel so I want to leave as soon as possible so I can arrive at my destination as soon as possible. I will be coming back at some point in the next few days - I am not sure when, so let’s keep that open. Can I have a ticket, please?\n\nI have two options: a manned ticket office or the automated ticket machine.\n\nIf I ask at the ticket office the Northern Rail staff usually ask “When are going?” And I’ll reply “Whenever the next train is.” I am then just told how it is, I pay, I get the ticket. Remember, we're talking between 6am and 7:30am on a weekday morning. I have been given a ticket by someone I presume to be trained in providing customers with the right product. Again, the Newcastle journey is about £60, for the off-peak return. Do I question this? No. Would you?\n\nIf it is a ticket machine I have got into the habit of choosing what the ticket office gives me. Because? I trust the expertise of the staff I’d previously talked to. And – let’s be honest – if all the other options say it’s alright to choose the cheapest options, I will.\n\nI’ve been doing this for about six months now, at least twice during the working week. £120 a week for two off-peak returns. £480 a month. At least. And that’s the cheapest option. Because that’s what a web service has told me is an option. Because that’s what humans have given me as my only option. And because the automated ticket machine doesn’t ask me when I am leaving and coming back, I just go with what the other two options have presented me.\n\nAnother thing to put into the mix: Not once has a train conductor pulled me up and said “There is a problem with this ticket.” “Ticket, please. Ah, thank you.” I have felt I have been doing it right, for the five or six months.\n\nDuring the past couple of months an unmanned train station nearer to my home, at Apperley Bridge, has opened. It means I could get an extra ten minutes in bed or an extra ten minutes on the dog walk, instead of going to Shipley.\n\nThe ticket machine hasn’t been working properly since the station opened, highly erratic, so sometimes I pre-book my tickets and pick them up on my journey home. Or I hop on the train and buy a ticket from the Northern Rail conductor. On the train I ask for a return to Newcastle, and the conductor gives me one, again an off-peak return of about £60.\n\nThis morning the ticket machine at Apperley Bridge wasn’t working for me, so I hopped on the train. I know this is illegal, but what else could I do? Also there’s always the chance to buy a ticket on the train from the conductor. And all else fails there's the ticket window at Leeds station.\n\nBy the time the train got into Leeds the conductor hadn’t reached me. So I went to the Tickets window at Leeds. I was made to buy a peak return to Newcastle. Cost: £75.50. That's about fifteen quid more than every other time I had been to Newcastle over the past half a year.\n\nThis morning at that window I was told several things by the Northern Rail staff at Leeds station:\n\n1. **“Travelling without a ticket is illegal.”**\nI knew this, accept this, and cool with this. But it’s a bit hard to actually buy a ticket when the ticket machine at the unmanned Apperley Bridge station wasn’t working and no conductor got to me on my train into Leeds. So I had no choice but to go to the ticket window at Leeds station.\n2. **“Travelling without a ticket is illegal” and therefore (and I quote) “invalidates my right to any discount.”**\nIt was made clear by the chap at the back of the ticket office that I was not allowed a non-peak return as I had got on the train without a ticket. Doing this removed any “rights” I had.\n3. **For the past five or six months I have been travelling illegally using an off-peak ticket. I should have bought peak tickets.**\nI have been buying the wrong tickets, despite explaining these being the tickets I have been given by Northern Rail's own staff over the past months. I showed some previous tickets (as I have to claim the trains back).

Something here is not right.","html":"<p>Since last July I have been working all over the country, but predominantly Newcastle. Rarely I drive up. Mostly I get the train. I like trains: the chauffeur experience, the chance to stare out of the window, the chance to read and write, the “Will I get a seat?” gamble. We’ve a pretty good rail network. What about the system that runs the network?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I book the ticket in advance, using the Trainline.com’s app.</p>\n\n<p>My user journey and needs are pretty straightforward.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am travelling from Shipley to Newcastle. I will be coming back at some point in the next few days - I am not sure when, so let’s keep that open. I want to [leave at/arrive by] this time on that day. Show me the tickets I can choose from.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My options for leaving are always between 6am and 7:30am. Invariably I go for the cheapest option against the times presented. An <em>off-peak return for about £60</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I turn up to the train station without pre-booking a ticket. My user need when I have turned up at a train station without a pre-booked ticket (which is pretty regularly) is pretty straightforward.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am travelling from Shipley to Newcastle. I have turned up to travel so I want to leave as soon as possible so I can arrive at my destination as soon as possible. I will be coming back at some point in the next few days - I am not sure when, so let’s keep that open. Can I have a ticket, please?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have two options: a manned ticket office or the automated ticket machine.</p>\n\n<p>If I ask at the ticket office the Northern Rail staff usually ask “When are going?” And I’ll reply “Whenever the next train is.” I am then just told how it is, I pay, I get the ticket. Remember, we're talking between 6am and 7:30am on a weekday morning. I have been given a ticket by someone I presume to be trained in providing customers with the right product. Again, the Newcastle journey is about £60, for the off-peak return. Do I question this? No. Would you?</p>\n\n<p>If it is a ticket machine I have got into the habit of choosing what the ticket office gives me. Because? I trust the expertise of the staff I’d previously talked to. And – let’s be honest – if all the other options say it’s alright to choose the cheapest options, I will.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been doing this for about six months now, at least twice during the working week. £120 a week for two off-peak returns. £480 a month. At least. And that’s the cheapest option. Because that’s what a web service has told me is an option. Because that’s what humans have given me as my only option. And because the automated ticket machine doesn’t ask me when I am leaving and coming back, I just go with what the other two options have presented me.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to put into the mix: Not once has a train conductor pulled me up and said “There is a problem with this ticket.” “Ticket, please. Ah, thank you.” I have felt I have been doing it right, for the five or six months.</p>\n\n<p>During the past couple of months an unmanned train station nearer to my home, at Apperley Bridge, has opened. It means I could get an extra ten minutes in bed or an extra ten minutes on the dog walk, instead of going to Shipley.</p>\n\n<p>The ticket machine hasn’t been working properly since the station opened, highly erratic, so sometimes I pre-book my tickets and pick them up on my journey home. Or I hop on the train and buy a ticket from the Northern Rail conductor. On the train I ask for a return to Newcastle, and the conductor gives me one, again an off-peak return of about £60.</p>\n\n<p>This morning the ticket machine at Apperley Bridge wasn’t working for me, so I hopped on the train. I know this is illegal, but what else could I do? Also there’s always the chance to buy a ticket on the train from the conductor. And all else fails there's the ticket window at Leeds station.</p>\n\n<p>By the time the train got into Leeds the conductor hadn’t reached me. So I went to the Tickets window at Leeds. I was made to buy a peak return to Newcastle. Cost: £75.50. That's about fifteen quid more than every other time I had been to Newcastle over the past half a year.</p>\n\n<p>This morning at that window I was told several things by the Northern Rail staff at Leeds station:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>“Travelling without a ticket is illegal.”</strong> <br />\nI knew this, accept this, and cool with this. But it’s a bit hard to actually buy a ticket when the ticket machine at the unmanned Apperley Bridge station wasn’t working and no conductor got to me on my train into Leeds. So I had no choice but to go to the ticket window at Leeds station.  </li>\n<li><strong>“Travelling without a ticket is illegal” and therefore (and I quote) “invalidates my right to any discount.”</strong> <br />\nIt was made clear by the chap at the back of the ticket office that I was not allowed a non-peak return as I had got on the train without a ticket. Doing this removed any “rights” I had.  </li>\n<li><strong>For the past five or six months I have been travelling illegally using an off-peak ticket. I should have bought peak tickets.</strong> <br />\nI have been buying the wrong tickets, despite explaining these being the tickets I have been given by Northern Rail's own staff over the past months. I showed some previous tickets (as I have to claim the trains back). When showing the Trainline app with the same price as the ticket I'd got from Shipley previously as another example it was explained “the Trainline has different rules”.  </li>\n<li><strong>I “should know what peak and off-peak is before accepting a ticket”.</strong> <br />\nWhether I buy a ticket from a train station ticket office, a ticket machine, or a web-based service I shouldn’t have to be the one that understands off-peak and peak travel.

Maybe this will mean we will end up making the same things.\n\nOf course it’ll be hard, of course it’s hard. We’re doing in the face of tradition, years of training to continue that way of working.

Codegirl is a documentary film centring on the all-girl teams taking part in the [Technovation](http://www.technovationchallenge.org) Challenge. [Here’s the film’s website](http://www.codegirlmovie.com) and [here’s the IMDB entry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5086438/).\n\nI left work at half twelve, got home at half three, had the daughter in tow, at Apperley Bridge train station by four, and got back home at 11pm, after the couple of hours’ train journey back (it’s been some long weeks with work and I didn’t fancy sleep-driving) – and on a school night. My daughter needed to be up for school in the morning and I had to be back on a train to Newcastle at 7am.\n\nIt was totally worth it.\n\nMy daughter’s 13 and at the age where’s she starting to – of her own accord as much of society’s accord – have a little think about “her future”. She’s pretty rounded, but has lingered on the fringes of what I do since her earlier days. She used to come into Brahm whenever she/I could get her in and has always been into the work I do. (I declare my daughter and son are my career audjudicators.)\n\nMy daugher’s asked me before about my time in AdLand, if I’d be alright with her doing the same as me – and I still stick by what I said to her then: If you find a place that *knows why it is doing the work* and *what marks that work as successful* there are fewer greater places to be than those agencies. Even if those agencies are rare. And that approach, of doing effective work, has been seeping out over the past few years – and it’s the approach that attracted me to work in government.\n\nA few years back [Mark Barrett](https://twitter.com/m_barrett) got me out of bed early on a Saturday to talk at the start of Leeds Data Mill’s [first hack weekend](http://leedsdatamill.org/community/blog/come-join-us-for-our-first-public-event/) – and my daughter, then eleven, asked if she could come. I tried to cram into ten minutes a “Know why you are making what you want to make, put users first” talk to keep the teams focused. My daughter loved it, and that was just the *design* bit.\n\nI help run the monthly [Coder Dojo in Bradford](http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo), where we do more *tinkering with tech* than design, and I don’t have to fight with her to come. She comes because she wants to. She isn’t of the *designer* or *techie* mentality many of my generation still subscribe to. She's of the *maker* mentality, where designing and producing are the thing.\n\nBut she’s also one of the few girls to attend these things. It’s something we’re mindful of at Coder Dojo, and have been trying to balance the gender split since the summer. It’s hard work.\n\nSo it was a rare feeling on Tuesday night not being fearful that she would, being a girl, be in the minority. I was worried she would be the only young person - but eventually there were a few other younger people in attendance, so no worries there. Brilliant to see.\n\nAnyway, the film was great. The Co-op building is great. (Apparently [a Boeing 737 can fit in it](http://blog.co-operative.coop/2015/07/29/7-things-you-may-find-interesting-about-one-angel-square/).) [Danielle Haugedal-Wilson](https://twitter.com/MrsDHW)’s intro talk about one of her life regrets was open, honest, and great. My daughter related to Danielle’s flashback to when she was the only girl doing tech stuff.\n\nWalking back to Manchester Picadilly the daughter and I were talking. “Did you hear what that man and lady were said they wanted to do there? That sounds *exciting*.”\n\nThe man was [Mike Bracken](http://mikebracken.com), who also did an intro talk, saying that the Co-op wants to do more of this stuff, be at the centre of it, because “We’re the Co-op. We co-operate.” It genuinely was exciting stuff. I just didn’t expect it have an impact on my daughter. (Mike’s notes from the night [are here](http://digital.blogs.coop/2016/02/25/codegirl-at-1-angel-square/).)\n\nThe daughter’s already gone back to her school and asked if they can show the film. They’re on with that. It’s the sort of moment that [Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg) laments about in [The Launch Pad](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670923494/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0670923494&linkCode=as2&tag=ermlikyea-21), the sort of moments that inspire a change, but Graham didn’t quite foster what that moment would be in the book.\n\nLeeds-way we’ve been wanting, needing an organisation, a sizeable organisation to take the lead, to pull everything together, to create an impact. (And there’s enough of them there now from Yorkshire Building Society to Sky.) That’s sort of by the by. Looks like the north-west is on well on that, with the Co-op joining the efforts of orgs like the amazing team at [Manchester Digital](https://www.manchesterdigital.com). Brilliant. And I’ll keep scuttling myself and my daughter over to those places and events that excite and inspire her. Thanks to the Co-op and Danielle for the most recent of those.\n\nOh, and the free crisps? Brilliant.\n\n*Check out some of the tweets from the screening of Codegirl at the Co-op on the hashtag [#codegirlatcoop](https://twitter.com/hashtag/codegirlatcoop?src=hash).*","html":"<p>A couple of days back I hot-footed across the country from Newcastle to Manchester, via Idle, to take the daughter to a showing of Codegirl at the Co-op’s HQ in Manchester.

(I declare my daughter and son are my career audjudicators.)</p>\n\n<p>My daugher’s asked me before about my time in AdLand, if I’d be alright with her doing the same as me – and I still stick by what I said to her then: If you find a place that <em>knows why it is doing the work</em> and <em>what marks that work as successful</em> there are fewer greater places to be than those agencies. Even if those agencies are rare. And that approach, of doing effective work, has been seeping out over the past few years – and it’s the approach that attracted me to work in government.</p>\n\n<p>A few years back <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_barrett\">Mark Barrett</a> got me out of bed early on a Saturday to talk at the start of Leeds Data Mill’s <a href=\"http://leedsdatamill.org/community/blog/come-join-us-for-our-first-public-event/\">first hack weekend</a> – and my daughter, then eleven, asked if she could come. I tried to cram into ten minutes a “Know why you are making what you want to make, put users first” talk to keep the teams focused. My daughter loved it, and that was just the <em>design</em> bit.</p>\n\n<p>I help run the monthly <a href=\"http://www.ticbradford.com/coderdojo\">Coder Dojo in Bradford</a>, where we do more <em>tinkering with tech</em> than design, and I don’t have to fight with her to come. She comes because she wants to. She isn’t of the <em>designer</em> or <em>techie</em> mentality many of my generation still subscribe to. She's of the <em>maker</em> mentality, where designing and producing are the thing.</p>\n\n<p>But she’s also one of the few girls to attend these things. It’s something we’re mindful of at Coder Dojo, and have been trying to balance the gender split since the summer. It’s hard work.</p>\n\n<p>So it was a rare feeling on Tuesday night not being fearful that she would, being a girl, be in the minority. I was worried she would be the only young person - but eventually there were a few other younger people in attendance, so no worries there. Brilliant to see.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the film was great. The Co-op building is great. (Apparently <a href=\"http://blog.co-operative.coop/2015/07/29/7-things-you-may-find-interesting-about-one-angel-square/\">a Boeing 737 can fit in it</a>.) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsDHW\">Danielle Haugedal-Wilson</a>’s intro talk about one of her life regrets was open, honest, and great. My daughter related to Danielle’s flashback to when she was the only girl doing tech stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Walking back to Manchester Picadilly the daughter and I were talking. “Did you hear what that man and lady were said they wanted to do there? That sounds <em>exciting</em>.”</p>\n\n<p>The man was <a href=\"http://mikebracken.com\">Mike Bracken</a>, who also did an intro talk, saying that the Co-op wants to do more of this stuff, be at the centre of it, because “We’re the Co-op. We co-operate.” It genuinely was exciting stuff. I just didn’t expect it have an impact on my daughter. (Mike’s notes from the night <a href=\"http://digital.blogs.coop/2016/02/25/codegirl-at-1-angel-square/\">are here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The daughter’s already gone back to her school and asked if they can show the film. They’re on with that. It’s the sort of moment that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg\">Paul Graham</a> laments about in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0670923494/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0670923494&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ermlikyea-21\">The Launch Pad</a>, the sort of moments that inspire a change, but Graham didn’t quite foster what that moment would be in the book.</p>\n\n<p>Leeds-way we’ve been wanting, needing an organisation, a sizeable organisation to take the lead, to pull everything together, to create an impact. (And there’s enough of them there now from Yorkshire Building Society to Sky.) That’s sort of by the by. Looks like the north-west is on well on that, with the Co-op joining the efforts of orgs like the amazing team at <a href=\"https://www.manchesterdigital.com\">Manchester Digital</a>. Brilliant. And I’ll keep scuttling myself and my daughter over to those places and events that excite and inspire her. Thanks to the Co-op and Danielle for the most recent of those.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and the free crisps? Brilliant.</p>\n\n<p><em>Check out some of the tweets from the screening of Codegirl at the Co-op on the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/codegirlatcoop?src=hash\">#codegirlatcoop</a>.</em></p>","image":"/content/images/2016/02/co-op-codegirl.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-02-26T15:32:16.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-02-26T16:35:56.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-02-26T15:44:59.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":128,"uuid":"6d61fbe9-a683-4adb-a939-cc74ad1c94cd","title":"(Untitled)","slug":"untitled-2","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-03-02T07:29:07.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-03-02T07:29:10.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null},{"id":129,"uuid":"9fbc6429-087c-42e4-a5f4-12c462ed0cbd","title":"Invisible Chinatown","slug":"invisible-chinatown","markdown":"[99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org) is a consistently brilliant podcast.
