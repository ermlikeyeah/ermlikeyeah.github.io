Following on from [my talk at Forefront in Leeds back in November](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/), I found a video on YouTube of an interesting chat between Jon Favreau and Martin Scorsese on Marty's preference of story over plot, or "rather because of character and a very different approach to story".

An interesting partner to my talk, the key moment is when Marty says "I know the plot and it's not interesting any more".

Which in turns reminds me of William Goldman: "Give the audience what they want, but not in the way they expect."
