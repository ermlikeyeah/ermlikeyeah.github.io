A few weeks back I rattled together a very quick sticker. I put it on Twitter. People seemed to like it. I’ve now done an asterisked, more “family friendly” version.

![I do this because I am f*cking sick things do't work people expect them to sticker](/assets/i-do-this.jpg)

So, I’ve sent that design off to the printers and got quite a few on the way. And I am giving them away.

If you want one (or some) of the sticker, I've set up a form to gather your details. Just [fill in the form](https://goo.gl/forms/fne6kDUVOVWsKlmC3) and I’ll do the rest.

You’re welcome.
