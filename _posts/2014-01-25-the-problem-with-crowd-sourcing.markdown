There's still mumblings about Ben Affleck being cast as Batman in whatever the sequel to *Man of Steel* is called.

If the noise generated by fanboys was acknowledged then Affleck would be out. Someone else would be in. Who? God knows. There's too many alternatives.

But the beauty of Affleck being cast? Hardly anyone called it. Warners just announced it, and a helluva lotta folk went *HUH?!*.

That it is a leftfield casting choice makes it all the more fascinating. It's a move that crowd-sourcing may never have come up with. And to me, it's a move that actually made me think "I can sort of see that. And I *want* to see that. It'll be interesting."

There's a lot to be said for giving people the chance to see something they would never have imagined. Long live disruption.
