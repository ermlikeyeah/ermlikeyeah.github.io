# Lie down and not fight

(With apologies to the Regulars.)

Earlier this year I [wrote about “us versus them”](/us-versus-them/). I am sort of revisiting that post.

I don’t like the word ‘fight’ at work to describe getting stuff done. It’s the language of conflict.

“You’ll have a fight on your hands for people to value in that.”

“You have to be up for the fight.”

“We’ve got a fight on our hands.”

“We’ll have a fight with the stakeholders.”  

You are having to fight against your team. You have to fight against the organisation. Your team has to fight against the organisation.

Can you see the resistance where you are? Is it from you? Your team? Or your organisation? Something is not lined up, and that’s not right.

Sometimes this is the result of frustration.

Potential is not the same as opportunity. Opportunity is when there is acceptance, when there is permission, when there is a desire to do something, to realise that potential. And, as much as I am sure we’d all love a flat structure, that has to come from the top.

Fights come when people see potential and do not have an agreed opportunity, an understood opportunity allowed to them. Frustration creeps in.

Over breakfast this morning I was re-reading [Martha Lane Fox’s *Directgov 2010 and Beyond* report, and Francis Maude’s follow-up](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution-a-report-by-martha-lane-fox). Maude notes:

> …as your report makes clear, this will be challenging for Government.

‘Challenging’ doesn’t mean the need for fights. ‘Challenging’ calls for diplomacy, working out a shared understanding, and acceptance of a path, acceptance of a mindset, acceptance of the opportunity. Word right from the top, from the off. And let’s crack on making things better.
