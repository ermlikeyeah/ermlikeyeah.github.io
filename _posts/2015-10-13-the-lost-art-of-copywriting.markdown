A week or so back [Rishi Dastidar](https://twitter.com/BetaRish/) shared a great copy led ad for [the Southbank Centre](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/) [on Twitter]( https://twitter.com/BetaRish/status/651027567663779840).

About the same time an excellent piece on the state of copywriting by Paul Burke popped up on [Campaign's website](http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/write-now-lost-art-copywriting/1367331). Take five minutes out and read [the piece](http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/write-now-lost-art-copywriting/1367331).

I've said before I'd take a copywriter over an art director (albeit only *just*), and the two reference points nails pretty much of why.

The only tweak would be to Burke's point *Copywriting was taught in schools*.

Over the years I've heard a few times "People learn English at school... So everyone is a copywriter" as an excuse to avoid getting a "proper writer" on the case – or even in the building. I am all for people having a go, showing their "other skills" – but there are times when the process of making needs specialist attention.

If we want a deeper reason why copywriting is a lost art, maybe there's a root cause.
