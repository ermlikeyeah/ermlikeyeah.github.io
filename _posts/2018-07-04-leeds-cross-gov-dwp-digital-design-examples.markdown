title: DWP Digital design examples session for Leeds gov design meet number 3
date: '2018-07-04 22:00:00'

At the third Leeds cross gov design meet, Chris Hanson and I did a session on the DWP Digital design examples. Here is a brief write up of the session we did.

---

So, a little bit about DWP Digital for those that don’t know too much about where we work. At a rough count DWP Digital has approximately 50 designers, that is people that have “designer” in their job title: service designers, interaction designers, and content designers.

We don’t have “user experience designer” as a job at DWP Digital. User experience design is the whole team’s role. So let’s also not forget the user researchers. Or the business analysts. Or the product owners. Or the front-end developers.

We have people designing and making services in 6 locations:

1. Newcastle
2. Blackpool
3. Manchester
4. Leeds
5. Sheffield
6. London

And there’s something like 60 “services” worked on. I use quotation marks deliberately because DWP Digital works on some end to end services and it also works on products that fit into wider services.

But that lots of work done, lots of work being done – and lots of people doing it.

I get asked “So, how do you go about designing stuff in government?” This usually is the lead into the real question. “Don’t you have these things called ‘design patterns’?”

Patterns.

Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns.

This is me every time I hear that.

Patterns is every poke in the eye.

Patterns. Poke.

Patterns. Poke.

Patterns. Poke.

Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns.

Poke. Poke, Poke, Poke.

Poke after poke after painful poke.

I’ve written and talked before about patterns. How some people see them as a thing you can just take off the shelf and HEY PRESTO you’ve copy and pasted your way to making an amazing thing. They’re not.

Patterns are there to get you from A to B, or A to C, or A to D, or A to E – not A to Z in one big leap.

So, I’ve been at DWP Digital for nearly eight months now. When I arrived one of the first thing I talked to some of the existing design posse was what we had for a design manual. We were working on a lot of “internal services”, the apparently unglamorous side of digital work: the systems that allow DWP staff to help people who need DWP’s help. Really important that, totally.

I’ve said before there’s a lot of people doing a lot of work. What we need to be doing is seeing more of that work. Forget patterns. Forget components. Let’s see what been made and what’s being made and work from there. The best bit of showing stuff off is you get to involve people!

To get this going at DWP Digital we did a pilot to try something that involved people. We booked a big room, somewhere in Leeds, and off site (to cut people off from any distractions), and we invited design people to come along: interaction designers, content designers, service designers, and user researchers.

Here we are in that room.

We asked anyone coming to bring along print-outs of some stuff from their services. One of those things was examples of “search” in services. In groups we analysed what we had and presented back to the rest of the room

It went OK, maybe even well. It didn’t go badly. So we’ve tried to hold them monthly.

We’ve had four so far:

1. Leeds
2. Leeds
3. Manchester
4. Newcastle

Here we are at the second meet-up in Leeds.

To help us make best use of the day together and so we can make continual gradual progress we have kept going sharing what we are going to be looking at in advance. And whatever is brought along is examples of work.

Sometimes this is harder than people think to work through. Here some of us at that second meet-up again.

We’re not looking to reduce every _thing_ down to one. We are looking to understand what works and what doesn’t work. Get rid of the stuff that doesn’t work. Make sure more the stuff that does work is used more often – and most importantly we are testing that stuff so we know it works and continues to work.

We make sure we involve the whole team, whether they were at the meets or not.

After every meet we make sure there is a write up which is shared, through Slack.

We use GitHub to organise our list of stuff to work through.

And the design examples channel on our Slack is really active: 49 people are members of that channel at the moment.

We are working through pulling together our own design examples “manual”, which Craig Abbott has pulled a first go of.

We regularly ask if the way we are doing all this works for us. We can adapt and change as and when we need to. At the moment we are making some solid progress – and it is something we are fitting in around the main work we do.

So, some of you may know that very recently the [gov.uk design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) launched. People has asked us, quite rightly, why are DWP Digital doing their own design examples thing?

I answer because we are part of the gov designer feedback loop. Over the years as designers on gov services we have taken stuff from the gov.uk design patterns. When we – designers sat in the various gov departments – have found something that works better than what we have borrowed, we have pushed that back into the wider gov.uk work

This will continue with the new gov design system.

An example: The work we have done at DWP Digital around tabs has fed into the gov.uk design system.

So, this work we are showing you is not a thing we are showing because it is done. It is something we are in the middle of. It is something we are doing. It is something we are working on and will continue to work on.

For me, at DWP Digital we need to make we do start with the needs of the users. We need to make sure that we understand the user needs and we meet those needs through our design work. That is what makes a pattern: the application of design components in a certain context that meets a user need. And research and testing plays a big part in that.

We are planning out fifth design examples get-together. It is not easy for many of our designers to the get the meet-ups, so we are also going to look at how we can do smaller sessions remotely more regularly. Keeping as many people as possible involved is so important as well as seeing as much work as possible.

Thank you to everyone at DWP Digital present and past, designer and non-designer, who has helped us get this far. We will keep doing it.
