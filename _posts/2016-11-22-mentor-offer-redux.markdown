[Back in April](/mentor-offer) I asked if anyone fancied some mentoring, specifically from me.

To be honest, I didn’t follow through. A combo of tying stuff up at HMRC and prepping to join the nhs.uk team got in the way of me replying. And since then it’s been full on.

Sorry if you got in touch. I hold my hands up. My bad.

Anyway, the offer still stands. The past six months is the first time in about 10 years I’ve not really been mentoring someone. And it’s something I miss. I like to give something back.

So if you fancy it – and ‘it’ would be hooking up every six weeks or so for about a year – [drop me a line](/contact).
