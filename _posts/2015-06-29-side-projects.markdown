Hacks. Tools. Apps. Whatever you want to call them, here's some little side projects I've done in recent years.

Apologies if they don't work any more.

####Cities of Something
A "How much an I do at lunch?" go from a quiet back at the end of 2014, which pokes a little fun at how UK cities need to be seen as a city *of something*.

Takes a list of UK cities, works its way through one-by-one, randomly chooses a phrase structure and drops in a randomly chosen word.

On the train home I created a US version. It's not the prettiest thing, mind. Does the job. Might revisit one day.

####Look up Scores on the Doors
I was curious what the Scores on the Doors were like near me. This quick hack takes openly available data and does some simple analysis. Needs some design work and the code could do with some efficiencies â€“ but it works.

####Amazolibrarymash
Take an Amazon wishlist and then look it up against the catalogues of Bradford, Leeds, or North Yorkshire libraries.

####Event Masher
Looks up and shows neatly the events out onto Eventbrite, Lanyard, and Meetup.

####Shall I Hang The Washing Out?
A quick web app that tells you whether you should hang the washing out, or not.
