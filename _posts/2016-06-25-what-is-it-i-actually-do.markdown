[Matt Jukes](https://twitter.com/jukesie) recently wrote a brilliant, really brilliant [piece on culture and hiring](https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-is-a-team-sport-c50d234745e#.3gaxom9p0) to supplement his [Design Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk) talk. Put the time aside and read it.

Matt also asked me if I could answer some questions for him, for a series called *Who Do You Think You Are?*. Easy peasy, I thought. Dipping in and out over two weeks I finally finished it. Matt's just published it. I won't be republishing it here any time soon, so [head on over and read it on Medium](https://productforthepeople.xyz/what-is-it-you-actually-do-simon-wilson-fe15a732b7ad#.kabylpgqz).
