It's now two months since I wrote about [getting Public Design WY going](/public-design-WY). The first meet-up is now done. Yay!

My thanks to [Leanne Buchan](https://twitter.com/LeanneBuchan) and [Lisa Jeffery](https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery) for stepping up to lead a session each.

Leanne talked with us about designing a city's culture strategy. You can find out more about that at [the strategy's website](http://leedsculturestrategy.co.uk/).

Lisa's session was on why she loved jamming, and gave the attendees the chance to do some jam activities. Lisa has made her slides [available for everyone](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yV66LDllJYMeiwbJTnyV99S3MRUTuTXC8grUg2nz9Fo/edit?usp=sharing). More information about the upcoming Leeds GovJam and jamming in general is on [https://leedsgovjam.com](the Leeds GovJam website).

Thanks to everyone who came. If you popped along I'd love to know what was good, not-so-good, and confusing. Leave feedback on [the event's Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239151881/) or [drop me a line](/contact).

Lastly, also a big thanks to [Futurelabs in Leeds](http://futurelabs.org.uk) for the awesome space.

There's a Twitter Moment with the all the tweets I am aware of. [See it here](https://twitter.com/i/moments/860369811288842242). Feel free to add your own into that.

And finally, Public Design WY will return. #2 is going to be on Tuesday 13 June, again at Futurelabs. All the info and saying you want to come will be [over on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239747499/) again.

And #3 is also planned. We'll be at [DHEZ in Bradford](http://www.dhez.org), pencilled in for Wednesday 12 July.

There won't be one in August, but in September #4 will be in Leeds.
