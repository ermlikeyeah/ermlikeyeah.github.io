Yesterday - Tuesday 3 July - we had the third Leeds cross gov design meet. (Following on from [the first](/leeds-gov-design-1-done/) and [the second](/leeds-cross-gov-meet-number-2-done/).)

About 20 people came along, and so so good to see a wide range of roles at a wide range public focused organisations represented. Thank you to all that came along and especially those that did sessions.

We are looking at doing a fourth meet in September.

Things we are looking for for future meets:

* People to run sessions. Sessions can be a talk, a show and tell, a workshop: anything you want as long as it has a gov or public sector slant.
* Places to host the meets. It would be great to have the meets in places where gov and public sector work happens.

If you want to help with either request [drop me a line](/contact).
