We’ve been down to London for the weekend. I’ve finished off [a book](//www.instagram.com/p/BQr6pjJAy3C/) I started last summer and have never got round to finishing fully (that last chapter, man, but for completeness’ sake), read another from start to finish, and also started another, The Inevitable by Kevin Kelly, which has [got me pretty excited already, just several pages in](//www.instagram.com/p/BQsPVb5A9S7/). Here is a grab:

Today we went to the Design Museum. A first chance to visit the museum in its wonderful new building and last chances to see the [New Old](//designmuseum.org/things-to-do/talks-and-events/pop-up-exhibitions/new-old) and [Beazley Designs of the Year](//designmuseum.org/exhibitions/beazley-designs-of-the-year) exhibitions. A great place to go, and the kids got a lot out of it – fatherly apprehension I had dragged them around something against their will and they would hold it against me in later life abated as we left.

I was reminded about last April, out in New York. Hard work, but really engaging. And I blogged about a particularly fun weekend I had, seeing a lot of designy things. Usually I splat these on Twitter or Instagram, but I liked/still like the idea of compiling those artefacts into a collected blog post. Here’s [one of those posts](/cooper-hewitt-nyc/) from NYC. And [here’s the other](/sunday-design-stuff-in-nyc/). I always forget to do this/that.

So, this post is a collection of Some Things That Caught My Eye. I put the images on [my Instagram account](//www.instagram.com/idlesi/) originally.

“The Eames House, created specifically to meet the designers’ needs… was built with off-the shelf components.” I love Charles and Ray anyhow. But again, starting with the needs before finding an off-the-shelf solution. Off-the-shelf is cool, but it has to be meet needs. [[View on Instagram](//www.instagram.com/p/BQsbSyrAfHY/)]
