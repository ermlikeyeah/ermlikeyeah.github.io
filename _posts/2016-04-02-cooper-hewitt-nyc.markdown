Met [Tom Harrop](https://twitter.com/tjharrop) for a trip to the [Cooper Hewitt](http://cooperhewitt.org), an excellent museum of contemporary design.

Despite  having fun looking for [UX/UI memes](https://twitter.com/tjharrop/status/716295360470257665), the museum is excellent. The screens and pens provided some excellent engaging interactions.

Monument Valley – or still from it – were on display. Great to see video games represented. Tom hasn't played it. ([Remember the numbers?](http://blog.monumentvalleygame.com/blog/2015/1/15/monument-valley-in-numbers))

The Models &amp; Prototypes room. Excellent, this. "Test concepts and resolve problems." I am sort of [into this protoyping game](/some-short-slides-on-prototypes) anyway, so this was an easy win for the museum.

Cute.
