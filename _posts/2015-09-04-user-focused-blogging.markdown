A quick note. I haven't written *and* published a blog post for a few weeks.

**1.** The [Thunk post](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/thunk/) from a couple of weeks back was just laying around ready to go out. One of those things I wrote a short while back and just wanted out there.

**2.** The [cat poster happy ending post](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/a-happy-ending/) was me quickly recording something cute I'd seen, mainly *user feedback in the wild*. I need to note more of that stuff openly, not just in [Evernote](https://evernote.com/). Good quick test.

**3.** I've been pretty damn busy since the [last proper post, which was on my first three weeks at HMRC](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/hmrc-nearly-three-weeks-up/), mostly with work.

**4.** I had some pretty awesome responses to that last proper post, not least [an actual cake delivered by the GDS team](https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/631740970011336704) (which I made sure was shared with the teams I am in - both the service team and the design team). The response to that post has given me ideas to write about and led me to chats which have lead to more ideas - on top of the existing ideas I had.

**5.** I've actually started writing four blog posts over the past month. *Four*. I haven't published any of them, yet, partly because none of them are finished. And...

**6.** I'll be honest, at the moment it's all a little overwhelming to know which one to start finishing, to know what people would want to read.

**7.** So, I've turned to [Stef Lewandowski](https://twitter.com/stef)'s excellent [Help Me Write service](http://helpmewrite.co/) to help me get some order going. And maybe to help you, the reader.

**8.** I write usually to get my thoughts down, sometimes to work things through, and sometimes they pick up a wider response.

**9.** I've transferred over as many of the ideas I've got in various places - tweets, emails, Trello, etc - to [my Help Me Write page](http://helpmewrite.co/people/ermlikeyeah/ideas). There you can vote for the things you'd want me to write, and even suggest stuff you'd want me to have a crack at.

**10.** Each Friday I'll look over the list, choose whatever is the most popular "open" post and write it to publish later the next week. If there's no most popular post, I'll pluck one and work on that. I might merge several topics together if there's a natural flow.

**11.** I'm aiming for a post a week. Pretty ambitious but good opportunities to get some stuff out of my head.

**12.** So, my ask to you, head over to my [Help Me Write ideas page](http://helpmewrite.co/people/ermlikeyeah/ideas), maybe submit some post titles/topics, but definitely vote for what'd interest you.

**13.** Thanks in advance!
