We already have researchers, content designers, interaction designers, service designers, and front-end devs at our weekly “user centred design” meet. Get product owners in Leeds to come to and be involved with these meets – and anyone else who is interested and passing by.

Get product owners involved with design decisions more.

It’s not about just the designer doing user-centred design. It’s not about the user-centred design team within a product-service team doing the design. We’re not just about user-centred teams. We’re a user-centered organisation.

The user experience is work of a team – it isn’t one person’s role.

Be clear what design is, what interaction design is.

Be clear where service design fits into DWP. And be clear what service designers can do within DWP (and DWP Digital): Let service designers be service designers (not filling in doing interaction design stuff).

Design in the open.

I must blog regularly.

We need to continue with the design examples - not styles or assemblies or components or patterns or whatever - work that has picked up in December work we have got. See what we’ve got. See what others have got. Rationalise from there. Have a meet in February about this with as many people as needed from across the org.

...and look at how this fits against all the other stuff happening across gov.

Get design out there more.

Share, show research and design whenever possible, locally within teams (at worst in the old-sprint review/new-sprint kick-off day) and globally across DWP.

Make our weekly meets worth people giving their time up. Have a focus every week, have a programme.

Have more regular reviews (or crits) of the things we are and have designed. And people shouldn’t be scared of leading these and coming to these.

Talk about design things that are outside of work.

On the outskirts of this, what can we do with the Digital Academy?

Not every team is chock full of people at the peak of their powers. It’s about supporting them and making them better as well as the products/services we work on. Value our people as people, and what we can do to make them better: It's about who you are, what you can do and could do.

Talk about work. Get out to the local universities. Invite in people interested in working for us and with us.

We need to build our skills. Understand what every role brings to the things we work on, the team and the org. Share learnings and knowledge. Teach coding. Teach designing. Build a library of books. Build library of our learnings.

Help those more junior than me. Support them whenever and wherever possible.

Likewise, don't take being senior as an excuse to ignore people. Listen to others. Don’t be one of those designers who values empathy with our “external facing users” but is cloth-eared to people they work alongside.

Already I have heard DWP Digital is there to do the web/tech/IT bit. Co-operation with colleagues further afield in DWP is essential. It’s not about power. It’s about appreciation of our skills and strengths to make things better collectively. 

The DWP people in Leeds already work with our DWP colleagues across the country. We can work closer with our public sector colleagues nearby to Leeds, be it NHS Digital, HMRC, Leeds Council, Bradford Council, our gov friends in Sheffield, and more. (I’m already setting up a cross-public services meet for Leeds based orgs.)

More clear strategy. More tactics against a clear strategy. (The map is old but it always current. It’s a living thing. http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/the-map-is-a-living-thing/)

It's OK to say we are just working on a product. It's not OK to ignore that the product is part of a service.

STICKERS!

POSTERS!

Be a shit umbrella for my colleagues.

Less talking, more doing.

Work hard and be nice to people.

Continual, gradual, improvement.

Review this list in the middle of March 2018. Plan for the next three months (if I am still around).
