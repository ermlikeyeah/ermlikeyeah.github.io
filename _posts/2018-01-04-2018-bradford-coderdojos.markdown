The first Bradford CoderDojo of 2018 is on Saturday 27 January.

Basically, we give our time to help your kids make stuff with computers so those kids can help other kids make stuff with computers. And maybe help parents too. It's free. Come along!

You can book a space through [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bradford-coderdojo-january-2018-tickets-41754813772?aff=es2). More information about the dojos are on the [Bradford CoderDojo website](https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io).
