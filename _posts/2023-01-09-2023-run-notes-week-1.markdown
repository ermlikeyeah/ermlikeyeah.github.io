Overall: Was aiming for at least 42km but had two days off running in the end (one planned rest day, one had too much work) so ended up near 33km. Pleased with Saturday’s long run (albeit ended up being much later in the day than planned). Achilles leans between aching and a constant niggle.

Average distance over the week’s sessions: (total distance / number of rides): 13.39km

Total time on the saddle: 2h 33m

#### Year so far

Ran: 32.86km
Distance left to run: 1367.14km

#### Goals for week 2

Run: 40km
Looking to have the majority of the runs closer to 10km rather than 5km. Aim for one run that is over 12.5km. Keep an eye on the Achilles. Keep it steady. Just need a little more focus this week, lots of life stuff to juggle. Be alright.

Bike: 40km

Walk: 15km
