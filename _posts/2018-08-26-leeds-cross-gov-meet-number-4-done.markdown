A couple of weeks back we held the fourth Leeds cross gov design meet. It was the biggest turn out yet, with 30 people turning up. Here’s some of them:

We had [Chris Burns](https://twitter.com/BadlyDrawnBurns), from the [English Institute of Sport](https://www.eis2win.co.uk), talk about being a product owner. If you have any feedback for Chris drop him a line through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BadlyDrawnBurns).

[Sophie Dennis ](https://twitter.com/sophiedennis) did a sterling job of reducing her exceptional session on strategy down to about 45 minutes. If you want the slides for Sophie’s session you can find them on [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/sophiedennis/lets-talk-about-strategy-extended-workshop-what-it-is-why-it-matters-and-how-to-do-it-well-sophie-dennis-90089444).

Finally Alex Leslie from [FutureGov](https://www.wearefuturegov.com) made it to the meet despite terrible train woes getting from Bradford. In the time left Alex breezed through the work FutureGov have done with Sheffield council. We try to ensure the meets are a safe space to be open and honest, and Alex certainly was. Thank you, Alex.

Any feedback, [let me know](/contact).

If you want to keep up to date I have finally (finally) got round to setting up a proper email list that is easier to subscribe to than the old Google Group. [Subscribe here](https://ermlikeyeah.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=870eb55ca9313c2008d961046&id=29e2ff3a78).

Thanks you to [ODI Leeds](https://odileeds.org) for hosting the meet. Time to sort the fifth one.
