Hi.

If you came to my session at Camp Digital yesterday, thanks. Feel free to [let me know](/contact) what you thought, good and not-so-good.

Yesterday was the only time I will be doing that session.

I am making the slides from the session available for all. Not sure how much use they will be, but you are free to have them. Let me know if you find them useful and you use them.
