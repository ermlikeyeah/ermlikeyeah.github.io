[Previously I left off](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-2) feeling disappointed and uncertain having not been told the outcome of my test results on Friday as planned, having seen the diabetes nurse previously on Tuesday 3 March.

Yesterday I remembered I could access my test results using SystmOnline, the system my GP practice uses.

I accessed the system and found my test results had been returned.

The commentary on the page showed the results had been reviewed and filed on Wednesday 4 March, the day after I saw the diabetes nurse.

Most of the results were within in the OK range. The one the doctor and I have been keeping an eye on is my haemoglobin levels. This was at 51. This was up on my previous test last summer. (I have [a spreadsheet](https://www.icloud.com/numbers/02wb223nySZ6XmUED4XcJQWzw#blood) where I save my results as I get them, all in one place.)

Back at the top of the page there is the narrative (albeit not that clear) _What you need to do: No Further Action_.

Having gone from a doctor appointment where the doctor set up the appointment with the diabetes nurse _to see what further we can do,_ the online system shows the outcome of the tests as there is _no further action_. I feel confused. The doctor was sure we would need to do more. This page says no need. Do I need to actually do anything? Is this why I didn't get the call on Friday? I don't know.

Yesterday the not-knowing hung over me. But today I am a shrug. I am confused, but I _don't know_. I like working with uncertainty, but I don't like living with troo much uncertainty. I like to live with facts. I am in the ubiqutuous corridor of undertainty, _a hole_ in a service even. There is nothing I can do. Tomorrow I am just going to ring the doctor's surgery. I'll feel like I am possible imposing, but I need to just know.
