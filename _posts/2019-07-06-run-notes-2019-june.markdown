#### Where I was at the end of the previous month, May 2019

Target to run in 2019: 1092 kilometres

Total distance ran so far in 2019: 601.4 kilometres

Recorded in [my little tracking spreadsheet](https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0cWhQqgPDF2FKXSnUdB79lWVw#2019_running).

#### Goal(s) for June 2019

👎🏼 Run at least 150 kilometres: Ran 141 kilometres, on 19 days out of 31, as had a knee niggle for the last week or so. So close though. Up to 742 kilometres ran this year, 68% of the way from the 1092 kilometres goal for 2019.

👎🏼 Run four 5 kilometre runs with an average pace of under 5:15 per kilometre: Managed three.

👎🏼👎🏼 Run four 10 kilometre runs with an average pace of under 5:45 per kilometre: Managed one.

👍🏼👍🏼 Run one half marathon distance: Ran two.

👍🏼 A speed session every week: Managed this every week but the last (because knee irk, see previously).

👍🏼 A stretch session every week: Managed this. Felt better for it as well.

👎🏼 Weight below 13 stone: Not quite.

#### The words

Bit of an up and down month, ending the month with a dot week due to a knee niggle.

Started strongly with 66 kilometres in the first 10 days setting up a strong month. I also started to go along roads a bit more, rather than just field and canaling it.
63 kilometres in the second third of the month, and we’re rolling. Had [a spritely post-work 5km on the 13th](https://www.strava.com/activities/2447479985).

That last third though: Wiped out. Ah well. At least my last run of the month was my first go at running on a fell. For fathers’ day the kids “bought” us a Saturday night in a bread and breakfast in the Lakes, so I took advantage on Sunday morning to [run up towards Muncaster Fell](https://www.strava.com/activities/2472803443). Hard going, but fun.

Did some scouting for different routes though, including having a walk round Baildon Moor looking at how all the paths criss-cross. Looks fun to just run round there.

A shame I was sidelined as I got some short Columbia running shorts. Man, I so wanted to show my legs off to the world. I bet the world wanted to see that too. Sorry, world.

I finished reading Scott Jurek’s [Eat and Run](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-Run-Unlikely-Ultramarathon-Greatness/dp/1408833409/) – and ended quoting him at the start of June’s Leeds gov design meet. “Running is just graceful falling” which is a bit like designing, I suggested with all the tenuity in the world. Good book though. Afterwards I enjoyed reading up on the internet about his mate Rusty.

Finally, I bought a couple of running vests to give my running T-shirts a break. Sorry in advance if you follow my running adventures on Strava or Instagram.

#### Next month’s goals

Run 160 kilometres. Working away a bit in July (near Newcastle) so there’s three challenges here:

First: Keep fitting some running in.

Second: A chance to try some new routes. (Already had [one suggestion](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/693344063), which looks fun.)

Third: Hit that 160 kilometres target. If I do I am over 900 kilometres for the year, and a solid August will have me nip past the target for the year. 🤞🏼

Not going for too many distance targets in July but looking to do four 10 kilometre runs during the month and try and have an average KM pace of below 5:45 for those runs. 🤞🏼

Another half marathon distance would be splendid too.

Another month of a good stretch session once a week. (And fit in some hip strengthening.)

See if I can dodge under 13 stone at last. 🤞🏼

Enjoy it still. (I am!)

🏃🏻‍♂️
