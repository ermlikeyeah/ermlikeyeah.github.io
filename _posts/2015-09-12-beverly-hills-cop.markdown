I caught a little of Beverly Hills Cop on Netflix last night. Not seen it for a while, was talking to people about Richard Pryor the other week, led to talk about Eddie Murphy.

I pop the film on while I've a spare five minutes. A delicious opening. The Faltermeyer score. The eavesdropping-from-across-the-road shots of Detroit folk. And then at the end of the film's intro credits, up pops this, the usual *Directed by*.

Just look at how that diagonal runs just off Brest's name. If it's a fluke, amazing. But there seems to have been some intent here. It looks lovely anyway. So I've grabbed it to share with you.
