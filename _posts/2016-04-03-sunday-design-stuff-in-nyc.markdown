Some guidance on how to work better. Possibly related to the [Peter Fischli and David Weiss exhibition](http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/fischliweiss-how-to-work-better) on at the Guggenheim.

Ended the day in the basement doing clothes washing, watching the Golden State Warriors game. More washrooms need a television.
