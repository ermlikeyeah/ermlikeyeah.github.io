We're going to hold a meet-up in Leeds for people designing government things, whether they are products or services or whatever you want to call them.

When? It will be on Monday 19 February, from 3pm until 5pm.

Where? This will confirmed this week, but it will be in Leeds city centre.

What will we be doing? We're going to aim for three or four sessions in the time we have together.

Already I've got someone interested in doing a session on policy in design. And we're sorting a session on registers.

There's space for a couple more sessions. If you fancy doing one drop me an email. And if you are worried or maybe put off about doing a session, don't be. You'll be in a room of people who will appreciate what you do and we'll support you all the way.

You can reserve a place at the get-together [on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-cross-government-design-meet-1-tickets-42817318753).

Any questions, [get in touch](/contact).
