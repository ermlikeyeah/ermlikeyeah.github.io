Hello.

A quick post.

In short: I am hanging round in government, at least for a short while longer.

I decided a few months back I would try to. It is truly a blast.

I don't live by regrets. But recently part of me regrets not having done it sooner. Those of you who said it would be my thing, you were right. Well done. There's a sticker for that.

In the face of longer contracts, offers of a higher day rate, and Important Sounding Job Titles, I am staying around government until the end of March.

Because despite longer contracts, offers of a higher day rate, and Important Sounding Job Titles, none of this takes into account the Work I Have Been Doing and The Work I Will Continue With, the work I am doing with the teams I am part of - the Inheritance Tax team, the design team, the UX team, the HMRC Digital team, the government team. (*Go, team!*, eh.)

There is much still to be done. Around the work, the way we work, about the wider service design.

I have six blog posts drafts, most of which touch upon that last bit. The wider service design. Not just making the "online service". The service design. Understanding and making better the services full stop.

It's no good asking users to provide information if they just don't understand: How they work it out accurately and confidently, where do they put that information, why they are doing it.

Government is particularly rubbish at asking people to give stuff they need because they are government – and not showing how them to do it easily, how to do it right. If government insists on demanding info government should be more guiding in the first place. Having call lines isn't the answer. They should be there for the people who *really need help*. Guidance should work for all.

A lot of work going on is looking address that, including digital services as part of that guidance.

I've said before Inheritance Tax is hard. I want to work so it isn't hard. I want to work for it to be as painless as possible.

I've [blogged before about doing research to make an online Inheritance Tax service](/research-with-users-to-understand-gifts). 

Last week we had user research sessions where I had tried lead us to look at the wider service, not just the digital bit, and find a way through Inheritance Tax for users, for citizens. This is hard when you are assigned to do *the digital bit*. But the difficulties outside of *the digital bit* can strangle your digital service. So you have to look back up the stream.

We came away from the sessions genuinely felt we had a breakthrough. A few days back we were in Nottingham and told some of our colleagues what we had done. I came away felt like we were fixing *the service*. We need more of this across government.

And with perfect timing there was also [this news](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/hmrc-fails-to-answer-thousands-of-tax-credit-calls) in the papers at the weekend (to go with all the other times while I've been working with HMRC people have moaned and whinged at me about the service they receive from HMRC).

I will blog more on the service thing later, I promise.

So, for the time being this means I will be continuing to bomb round the country, to meet colleagues within wider government, and everyday people. At the moment I visit at least three cities in the UK every week for work, and I don't want that to stop.

By the way, Sky in Leeds are hiring.
