I’ve written before about [looking sideways](/look-sideways-more/), getting out of your bubble to see how others do things. There’s a flip side to that.

Over the past few years* I have always had time to help educate and have conversations about design and digital, from sessions — talks, lectures, and classes — at universities, drop-ins sessions at places like the DWP Digital Academy, to regularly being a mentor at [Bradford CoderDojo](//bradford-coderdojo.github.io/). I prefer these opportunities to “public speaking gigs”. (I’ve only accepted one public speaking engagement in the most recent years, [at the excellent Camp Digital conference](//www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/archive/2017/simon-wilson/).)

Usually these opportunities to share and teach have come as a friendly request through my networks. It’s some stuff — but I don’t think it’s enough. I’d like to do more.

I’d like to talk about and share even more the work I do and have done, with the teams I’ve been a part of, and how we have done that work. I also want to have more conversations about what “design” is and can be.

If you're in education — whether you’re a course leader, teacher, or student — and you’re interested in me coming into where you are or would like to come to where I work, let’s have a chat. My details are the [contact page](/contact). I would love to help you.

And if you’re reading this and considering making a similar offer, do it.

*Just worked that out. Since about 2004.
