Hello. From early June I will be spending some time during the week "closer to home". This means I will be about Leeds and Bradford more than the past ten months – by actually being about.

I'd like to use this chance to offer myself as a mentor to someone who is looking for one.

There's some stuff about me over on [my about page](/about).

Ideally I am looking for someone who is into design and digital, doing effective human-centred work, collaboration, and how design and technology can enable better. A student, someone who is the earlier days of their career, or someone who has been longer down the path and wants a bit of focus and brio. I'd be up for any of those – and I'd be happy for it to be a confidential arrangement. Maybe meet every four to six weeks for an hour or so to keep it ticking along.

If you think we could be good fits, get in touch and let's chat. Details of how are on [the contact page](/contact).

Cheers.
