I was in the Rec this morning and all the dandelions are out in FULL FORCE. One of the best times of the year. Also means all the knot- and bind-weed will be out on the veg patch. One of the worst times of the year.

Last weekend I made a fence. And I do mean _the weekend_. I ended up watching the first Sunday NBA game as I did the last screwing. I planned it a couple of months back (loosely), ordered some materials which took a while to come, used the weekend before last to see how some of the materials knitted together, tweaked the plans a little, ordered some more bites and bobs and then spent the whole weekend making the fence. Which also meant tweaking the plans as I worked through the making (getting the length of fence alongside the shed took a little experimenting but was fine once I had a method that worked). But I planned for that so it’s all fine. All the way through I was enjoying it — because it’s nice to realise things you design — but also aware I was doing because it was well within my skills: I’ve done fences a bit over the years. (The back-up career, no doubt.) I think this is the first time I’ve considered the materials for a fence a lot deeper though, digging into types of wood, treatment and thickness. I would have happily paid someone else to do it all, but I had the skills, knowledge, time, money, knowing suppliers — and the urge. _Satisfaction_ unlocked.

The Fence had me thinking _a bit_ about all those _should designers code?_ discussions that break out on Twitter, like a bout of athlete’s foot. They’re all too simple. Too sweeping one situation suits all from some dear thought leaders, there are multiple meanings to _code_ in designing (I started to think about _coding_ when you doing research analysis for one). But anyway. Not for here. (Or Twitter. I mute that shit.)

Had the last [Signature Lo-fi beer](https://www.signaturebrew.co.uk/collections/live/products/lofi), stashed in the shed. Criminally a) I saw Sarah D post about it on the ‘gram, b) I bought some, c) despite already having about 20 cans/bottles of other low alc beers. Good beer though. Was tempted to buy some more but want to run my stocks down some more first. But Drummond is now officially a Thought Leader in my books.

Not read many blog posts this week, but got through [Mark’s post on products](https://mhurrell.co.uk/prospects/starting-to-look-up-again/), starting from Kanye’s trainers. Worth a read.

Related (sustainable products): Have the web page for [Saucony Jazz Court RFGs](https://www.saucony.com/UK/en_GB/jazz-court-rfg/48766U.html?dwvar_48766U_color=S70562-1) lurking in a tab. Must resist. _Must_.

Finished _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_ at last. Thumbs up all round.

Watched the [Shang-Chi trailer](https://youtu.be/giWIr7U1deA) a few times, half for the comment someone left _Asian Parents Expectations 100% on point_.

Got drawn into Animal Planet videos of things like (look away now) [a man who has a barnacle growing inside his hand](https://youtu.be/tAmSR-SRmMI). I advise you don’t start. I wasted an hour of my life in that wormhole. Absolutely fearful bind-/knot-weed fluid on my hands will see the stuff spouting out of my hands and arms like Swamp Thing.

Not a lot to say about Basecamp. Yes, feel for the employees, but _it’s a company_. Owners gonna own.

Yes, I know Town got relegated. I was sat on my bike watching it as it happened. Related: My port stocks are now super low. Fact: Port is popular in England especially due to a trade embargo on French wine in something like the 17th/18th century.

Wrote [a run note](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/run-note-for-april-2021/) about the last four-or-so months of running lyf. It’s always good to be out and about, but nice to be doing it with a bit more pace. It’s definitely not been bad having to maintain a walking pace the last few months: I’ve spotted things I would have just run past before, a couple of paths off to places. Slowing down isn’t the worst thing you can do.
