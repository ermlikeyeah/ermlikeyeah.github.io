One weekend back in August I was slumped in a chair in a front room a short drive from Washington DC catching the end of [Jimmy Fallon square off with David Chang for a hot wing eating contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM-Wr8oqeYk). Chang's one of those guys that [I find fascinating](http://business.time.com/2013/09/26/david-chang-broke-all-the-rules/).

There's a great talk from the recent WIRED By Design event of Chang [talking about making deliciousness](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/david-chang-shares-secrets-behind-momofukus-delicious-success/). Chang's talk focuses around cooking, but you can replace 'cooking' with whatever field you work in. The talk's really about leadership, creativity, and allowing creation to happen - and there's a nice little nod in there towards everyone in an organisation being business savvy. (Otherwise what is the point?)

Also, deliciousness, eh! What a great word!
