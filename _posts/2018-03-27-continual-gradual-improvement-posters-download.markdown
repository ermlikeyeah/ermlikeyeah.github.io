Just before Christmas I did some posters at work that said "Continual Gradual Improvement". Grind 'til we shine and all that, yeah?

Here's an A4 print of it, on my desk at home.

A couple of people have asked if they can have it as a PDF, so while I was sorting that I thought I'd make it more widely available.

Get it as [a PDF](/assets/continual gradual improvement - a4 - artwork.pdf) (which will scale fine to A3) or [a JPG](/assets/continual gradual improvement - 3200px - screen.jpg).

And maybe drop me a line if you stick it up somewhere.
