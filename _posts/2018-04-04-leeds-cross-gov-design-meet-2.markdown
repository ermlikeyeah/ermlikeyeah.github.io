A couple of months back we held the first Leeds cross gov design meet at ODI Leeds. We had excellent sessions from Ellie Craven from GDS, Pete Smith from NHS Digital, James Johnson from DWP, and Caroline Jarrett from Effortmark. I wrote a post just afterwards. You can [read it here](/leeds-gov-design-1-done/).

Onto the next session! We have some space at ODI booked for the second Leeds cross gov design meet on Wednesday 18 April, from 1pm to 3pm. We’ll be looking at three sessions in the two hours. I’ll be looking to sort the sessions next week.

If you’re a designer, researcher, product owner, or team who has done or are doing something interesting and want to share [give me a shout](/contact) and we’ll see what we can sort out. Don’t be shy!

Space at the meet is limited so there’s only room for 20 people. You can get a place [on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-cross-government-design-meet-2-tickets-43515337546).

In some personal news this will be the last gov design thing I will be sorting in Leeds for the forseeable future. I’ve got other things to concentrate my energies on in the coming months. After six “public design” meets in 12 months – two of these and the four [Public Design WYs](/this-is-public-design-wy/) – it’s a good time to see if anyone out there wants to take the baton and keep the cross gov design meets going in Leeds. [Give me a shout](/contact) if you fancy it!
