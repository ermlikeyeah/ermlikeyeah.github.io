Getting a shed was the best idea. It is currently my standards-principles-elements-patterns workshop.

We are short of wall space at work – and short of time during the day to get this stuff done. Standards-principles-elements-patterns help us make consistently designed services.

And if you are going to do this stuff out-of-hours, you might as well set up shop somewhere comfortable.

So I have.
