I like traveling by public transport.

Aside from accidentally hearing Game of Thrones spoilers, I sometimes get to overhear design and creative chats. The benefits of the Shipley to Leeds commute, eh.

I earwigged a conversation the other day, the general gist was creating visuals in Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”, whatever the circumstance.

The only way. To create. A good prototype.

A good prototype.

Remember [the definition of *prototype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype).

> A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.

Prototypes are there to allow you to explore an idea, a thought, a theory, an approach. How that prototype manifests is totally up to you.

Photoshop is cool. As are all the various other ways: paper and pens, Pop, Marvel, Sketch, Keynote, using a code framework, acting, and so on.

If you are more comfortable with a certain way of prototyping over everything else, great, good for you. But there is no *one way* to creating prototypes, let alone *one way* to create a “good prototype”.

A “good prototype” takes into account what we are exploring. If we are exploring a particular medium then maybe Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”. But, again, Photoshop over Sketch, Keynote etc? Photoshop is not the *only way*.

A prototype is something you create with all the tools from your own creative toolbox. It doesn't need to be *beautiful*. Use what’s right for you and right for your project.

If you think there’s only one way to do "good prototypes", then get real. Get prototyping your prototyping.
