Met [Tom Harrop](https://twitter.com/tjharrop) for a trip to the [Cooper Hewitt](http://cooperhewitt.org), an excellent museum of contemporary design. Despite  having fun looking for [UX/UI memes](https://twitter.com/tjharrop/status/716295360470257665), the museum is excellent. The screens and pens provided some excellent engaging interactions.

Monument Valley – or still from it – were on display.

The Models &amp; Prototypes room. Excellent, this. I am sort of [into this stuff](/some-short-slides-on-prototypes) anyway.
