I did a session today at the DWP product owners meet on designing. I was given half an hour. I am sure I overran. Anyway.

The aim was to get a first draft of what is design and designing to DWP Digital, how to go about it, how we are going about it, where a product owner fits in, and start a conversation about it. There was a lot to fit in, and lots got cut. But it is a start, a reminder for some, laying some groundwork for others.

The slides are here:

At the same event Tom Morgan did an excellent session on hypothesis driven design. Tom's slides [are here](https://speakerdeck.com/tsmorgan/hypothesis-driven-design-17th-may-2018), and worth checking.
