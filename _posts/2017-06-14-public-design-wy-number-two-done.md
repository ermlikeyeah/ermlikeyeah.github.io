After [the first Public Design WY](/public-design-wy-number-one-done/), the only way forward was a second!

Unfortunately [Sophie Dennis](https://twitter.com/sophiedennis) had to postpone her session on adventures in policy land, but we were still able to entertain and be entertained by [Phil Sherry](https://twitter.com/nonswearyphil). Phil works with HMRC, and trekked down from Newcastle to talk about accessibility.

When I heard about Phil's talk (when he first did it at [Frontend NE](https://frontendne.co.uk) a short while back) it sounded a good primer on accessibility as a thing you just do, with just enough technical stuff and examples to lift the lid for those curious to dive deeper.

There's a strong argument if you design inclusively then accessibility is usability. Don't see accessibility as some checkbox commitment or something to bolt on afterwards.

As Phil put it:

>Screen readers first, mobile, then desktop when designing

Phil's session was one of the strongest I've seen in a long time with practical, pragmatic advice. If even one person that came to the meet-up learnt something and takes that into where they are, then job done.

Some tweets from the night were posted on Twitter with the hashtag. You can [see them here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a11yatPDWY&src=typd), and feel free to speak to Phil over on Twitter.

Phil referenced a lot of sources. He's [put that list online](https://philsherry.github.io/a11yatFNE/) for people to refer to, and read through. Lots of great stuff in there. The slides from Phil's original talk at Frontend NE - which he tweaked for the session with us in Leeds - are [on Speakdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/frontendne/adventures-in-accessibility-testing).

For what it is worth, [my intro slides are also available](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1edZ4P0gPiMDcH4NlyKOM9806ofTTfpwsV0V9d0GZYqo/edit?usp=sharing) for wider use.

Thanks again, Phil, for making the effort to come down – and hopefully Sophie feels better soon.

A massive thanks to [Futurelabs](http://futurelabs.org.uk/) for the space and everyone who came along. Neither are taken for granted.

If you came along to the meet-up you can leave feedback over [on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239747499/) or [drop me a line](/contact).

For the next Public Design WY we'll be heading over to Digital Health Enterprise Zone and Digital Catapult Yorkshire space in Bradford on Wednesday 12 July. Details are [over on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239752118/), and we'll be announcing later this week who'll be leading the sessions there.
