There's been a really great Saul Bass pitch doing the rounds on the digital socials at the mo. (Even though it was posted in late 2011.)

A reminder that Bass didn't just do cool [title sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM3McG4-LE) for Alfred Hitchcock and [quad posters](http://www.saulbassposterarchive.com/gallery/film-posters/). And a reminder even people as revered as Bass had to pitch.

It's well worth half an hour of your time. Don't worry. The image above isn't a late spoiler -- it's early on. There's plenty more great moments in the film.
