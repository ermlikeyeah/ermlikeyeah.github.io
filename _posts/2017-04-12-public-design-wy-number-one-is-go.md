A few weeks back I [wrote about trying out Public Design WY](2017-03-11-public-design-WY). Originally the plan was to hold it on Wednesday 29 March. Due to a few things (work, Article 50) we put it off.

We now have a date, a time, and a space:

Where: [Futurelabs in Leeds](http://futurelabs.org.uk).

When: Thursday 4 May, from 6pm until no later than 8pm. We will be going for a "debrief" in a pub afterwards.

This session is open to anyone who is interested in design in the public sector. That is "design" as a wide view, and we are looking at the public sector, again as a wide view, wider than just in gov.

Public Design WY is free to attend. You just need to tell us you want to come.

How? We have [a page for meetup #1 on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239151881/), where you can say you want to come along and get further updates.

The agenda will be announced in very soon, but just getting interesting and interested people along is half the fun.

So, please come! And hopefully see you there!
