### What did I set out to do in January?

* I am looking to run 2000km in 2020. That means running an average of 170km each month. As January was the first month I tried to hit that 170km mark.
* No run to be shorter than 5km.
* Avoid running in the gym as much as possible. The treadmill is the back-up, for emergencies.
* Record for every run my pre run mood and my post run mood. This should be easy to add into the notes for a run recorded in Strava. Just remembering to do it.
* To read one book about running amongst my other reading.

### How did I run in January?

* I ran 170km.
* I ran on 23 out of 31 days in January.
* I ran on a treadmill for 3 of the 23 runs. Good going having so few ‘miller times!
* 2 runs were under 5km: One because I only had half an hour to get changed, run and change back; The other after a very early start and long day at work so _something at the end of the day was better than nothing_. I am OK with this.
* I recorded my pre run mood and post run mood (using emojis) for every run.
* I seemed to be nursing a sore lower right leg for most of the month. I think it is passing, but I need to keep an eye on it.
* I particularly enjoyed my run on [Monday 20 January](https://www.strava.com/activities/3027932949), out to Shipley and back. It was a fresh day, I was running in the afternoon, and I felt I had a good pace to me.
* I didn’t take part in any races. I did five races in the last couple of month of 2019. I have mixed feelings on doing them.
* I ran with colleagues from work for [the first time](https://www.strava.com/activities/3048311647), after work on Monday. After getting up at 4am and being in work so early it also made me finish work for the day after a decent shift. I also enjoyed the slower pace, the chat with a couple of people I enjoy spending time with, and supporting someone getting into running.

### What did I learn?

* In January I reflected on the previous 12 months. 13 January 2019 marked my “[first run](https://www.strava.com/activities/2301130154)” into what has become a habit. On a treadmill, doing 5km, a few pauses, an average pace of 7:00/km. It took effort and patience. Now I just head out of the door and 5km is — while nothing because it takes time — something I can just roll with.
* I am at the point I feel running is one of the few things in my life I am in control, I can bend to the restraints and constraints to do something and be content with that, but I always feel ahead of where I should be. It’s good for the mind to no always feel behind, which I do about so many other things.
* In the shorter days at this time of year I should do my best to go for a run in daylight. They just feel _better_.
* Runs along the main roads at 9pm are more peaceful than I thought they’d be.
* …But I also struggle getting to sleep before 11:15pm if I do them.
* ‘[Sisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu)’, not just a Finnish word but a Finnish characteristic.
* I read [Running to the Edge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880041-running-to-the-edge) and learned about [Coach Bob Larsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Larsen) and what he learned about running, the mix and the balance between science and creativity, and making sure you have a thoughtful approach to your work. It resonated with my running but also with my work.
* If it looks like it is going to rain and you’re off on muddy trails err on the side of caution: Wear running shoes with suitable grip. (I made this mistake [last Sunday](https://www.strava.com/activities/3044605604). I should have known better to be honest.)
* There is a difference between the heel and the sole of a shoe.
* A couple of people have talked to me how my antics in 2019 motivated them to do more walking and running in 2020. I look forward to hearing about them!
* I stopped using Instagram towards the end of 2019. I miss seeing people’s trips to places, running and otherwise, on there. (I don’t miss the Facebook-y family and LinkedIn-y work updates though.) Maybe I’ll go back.
* I haven’t really missed doing a race. Maybe running solo is my thing.
* These days the dog really struggles with our runs together. She’s just not into them, even though I [slow the pace right down](https://www.strava.com/activities/3022375722), I am constantly having to wait for her. I _think_ she’s nervous where we go.
* I cannot recommend enough the [New Balance Impact Tights](https://www.newbalance.co.uk/men/clothing/trousers-and-tights/performance-pants/impact-run-tight/MP01247.html?dwvar_MP01247_style=MP01247BK#style=MP01247BK). They help keep the chill off the legs, sure, but the pockets along the thighs are such a good idea — and done well. I put my phone in one (which I have to take with me if I leave the kids at home for a short while) and don’t have to worry about it flapping about in a shorts pocket or my jacket pocket or wearing a phone holder.
* I am enjoying watching [Stef](https://www.strava.com/athletes/47920858)’s attempts to get running regularly.

### What am I looking to do over the next month?

* 170km again.
* Avoid running in the gym as much as possible.
* Do some sprint work.
* Run a half marathon distance run.
* More daytime runs. I am particularly bad at not halving my working days and using a break in the middle to go for one.
* Read another book about running. (I already am: Scott Jurek’s [North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37770246-north).)
* Keep enjoying it!

### What am I looking for?

* Any great 7km to 15km routes you know of near Bradford and Leeds, I’d love to hear about them.
* Any reading books you liked? Let me know!
