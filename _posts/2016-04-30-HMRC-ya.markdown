Early this week I told my manager and my fellow designers at HMRC's digital delivery arm that [I am leaving](https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/725374078211727361). I had an offer. It wasn't the first I have had over the past few months. But this time I wasn't going to say no. It feels the right time, it feels the right opportunity.

I joined HMRC last July, after much nudging from pals and accepting an offer from the then-head of design, [Andrew Travers](http://trvrs.co). I haven't regretted it or hated it.

At the turn of the year I was saying "no thanks" to chances to go back to being a head of this and a director of that. I was alright just being an interaction designer. I was even flirting with the idea of applying for the head of digital design role at HMRC after Andrew's departure. (Which I put off after learning-about-by-seeing the annual reviews. Another story for another time). It's not all a bed of roses, but it's not all bad. Good stuff to get on with, other stuff that needs to be better.

It's good to stay grounded, keep perspective. Not too head in the sky, not too head in the sand, not too much head in hands. Once a month I try to make sure I spend time away from the current thing. If I am near somewhere I find interesting I'll drop them a line. Hi, I am in the neighbourhood, can I pop in, have a chat, even a snoop. More often than not I get a "Sure!". Some of those places are other bits of gov, some are non-gov. These trips give learnings and a sense of perspective.

Recently I had a couple of weeks away from gov, spent time at a place dedicated to making digital products. Top drawer place, top drawer people, top drawer way they with work with their clients, top drawer how their clients work alongside them. Agile. Talent. Collaboration. Modest, focused MVPs. Getting stuff out there. Flattish structures. Alignment. It was difficult not to reflect on what I was going back to at HMRC. It was a reminder of the ways can be. It was a reminder of the way things are.

HMRC has come a long way. That progress may be relative within government, but it is getting there. And it is getting there also compared to the outside world. Change doesn't happen overnight. HMRC is having a go, throwing a lot of resource at it (I'd say people and technology, but "resource" is how HMRC views it). But it is getting there, trundling along, in their way. But there's still a way to go. This is a behemoth modernising after all.

To me HMRC does work that does matter. It gathers the funds that are redistributed across government, to services, for people, and to people. It genuinely effects people. For that reason it is hard to leave.

There is also a great team of designers at HMRC. Genuinely talented, passionate people that want to make things that work. It will be hardest to leave them behind. There are people there I have enjoyed working alongside, supporting. I wish I could have been able to do more. As content as I was being just an interaction designer, that in its own right reduced the ability to affect wider change(s). I am sure the lure of HMRC will be enough for a good interaction designer to go in and contribute to that community, that work.

I always feel privileged and proud to be one of the many involved with this work, and will always be thankful to Andrew for letting me in last summer. But it's the right time to move on and go somewhere that is more in line with what I want to do, how I work and want to work.

And there are times when you are asked if you'd work with them it's a case of you just cannot say no. There are some things in life you only say yes to. This is one of them. I will be joining the nhs.uk team.

There is already a talented team of people working on nhs.uk that isn't massive. This isn't about throwing loads and loads of resource at something. It's about the right people and technology working in the right way for the job. And the management are a part of that team, one foot in, one foot out – not above, pushing into the team. I think these are important things. And the most important thing: This is work for you. This is work and ways of working made of the right stuff. A sign of that progressivism is the work they are doing has recently [moved into beta](http://digital.nhs.uk/moving-to-beta).

I believe that more government digital transformation work would benefit from having more of a "start up approach", [runways](https://www.agileplannerapp.com/blog/building-agile-planner/how-long-is-your-startup-runway) to instill some "must do", building a solid core that has value – that works – to the users and getting it out there sooner, and iterating around and on that. And always with user needs driving the service design. It feels there is a lot of that within the nhs.uk team.

It won't be easy or straightforward, but as I was reminded a month back when everyone is involved, when everyone – from side to side, from bottom to top of whatever the org structure – is attuned, when everyone is willing, when everyone communicates, talks, understands, it enables you as a team to act as unified collective on what is needed, to get through what is needed faster, and get what is needed out there faster. That I will have the chance to be back in Leeds more doing this work was just a bonus.

One thing I will definitely say: This is a great time to help government change. Whatever your political persuasions making better digitally enabled public services is what we should be doing. You expect it from so many other bodies. You should expect it of the body/bodies that look after our society.

There are so many other bits of gov working on this change. While meeting the [government digital by default service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) by putting user needs at the centre of the work is their shared approach, their problems, their environments, their context can be so different. There are so many opportunities to help make things better. Some will be better for some people than others by virtue of the opportunity's collective chemistry. The choice is there (even if it is you prefer using a PC laptop to a Macbook).

You could be involved too. If you're talented you should be. We need more talented people doing this work. If you want to help this change and willing to learn you should try as well. Gov is a great place to learn, to be nurtured.

And, especially, if you are a user-centred designer available to work from Newcastle in about four weeks time when I head off. I am sure HMRC would love to hear from you.
