"You want the things you make be so good and better than all the stuff you made before and good enough to live up to you up to your crazy expectations of what makes your things good. And I'm an idiot."

Great talk from Lisa Hanawalt, who helped create Bojack Horseman, at this year's XOXO. Open, bare, and really, really funny.
