Having said a short while back that [Leeds cross gov design meet number 2](/leeds-cross-gov-meet-number-2-done/) would be the last I could sort, I have some time to sort number 3. It is nice to be able to keep them going.

I am currently looking at the week commencing 2 July. I have set up a [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/6yfczgr6w86afbhs) to help us choose the best time and day. The poll closes in a week, on Friday 9 June.

I have also set up a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-gov-design) as well to help cross gov design people keep in touch – and also announce planning and when the meets are. Feel free to join.
