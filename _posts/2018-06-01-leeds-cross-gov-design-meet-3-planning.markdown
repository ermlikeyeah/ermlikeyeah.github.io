Having said a short while back that [Leeds cross gov design meet number 2](/leeds-cross-gov-meet-number-2-done/) would be the last I could sort, I have some time to sort number 3. It is nice to be able to keep them going.

I am currently looking at the week commencing 2 July. I have set up a [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/6yfczgr6w86afbhs) to help us choose the best time and day. The poll closes in a week, on Friday 9 June.

I have also set up a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-gov-design) as well to help cross gov design people keep in touch – and also announce planning and when the meets are. Feel free to join.

Feel free to share these with anyone you know who work on gov or public services in and around Leeds.

As usual, any questions or thoughts, [give me a shout](/contact).
