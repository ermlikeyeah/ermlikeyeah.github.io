Half term, time for a proper little holiday for the first time in a long time. Time away from [the current gig](/tag/hmrc/), time with the family, time to reflect on a few things, time to do some other stuff. Also, my 40th birthday was in there.

I took full advantage of Birthday Privilege to drag the family to the Barbican for their [World of Ray and Charles Eames exhibition](http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18398).

In short: Excellent.

Lots to look at, watch, and read, including a full multi-screen recreation of *[Think!](http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/think/)*. Two hours well spent in the breadth of the Eameses' consistently excellent work and thinking. (There's [a solid overview on Creative Review](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/october/ten-things-to-see-at-the-world-of-charles-and-ray-eames/).)

Worth noting: The Barbican's wall text and captions are *excellent*. I respectfully didn't take shots of any (instead writing notable excerpts on the back of our tickets). There's an excellent one at the top of this post.

And this [Alexander Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Girard) quote particularly struck a chord.

Handily, to save you deciphering my handwriting, the Barbican have now uploaded the wall text and captions to [their website](http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18398). You can [view them on a PDF here](http://www.barbican.org.uk/media/events/18398theworldofcharlesrayeameswalltexts.pdf).

One of the wall texts had me coming away feeling I am not the only person seemingly concerned with the process of design. (It's my little paranoia, and undercurrent in [a recent post](/mis-shapes/).) So, thanks for whoever wrote that. Reaffirming.

Fellow process enquirers can view Charles Eames' design process diagram [on the Eames Office website](http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/charles-eames-design-process-diagram/).
