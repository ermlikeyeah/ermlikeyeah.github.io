In the NHS beta team we try to do things openly. We publish little snippets on the [#nhsbeta hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23nhsbeta&src=typd) We [blog regularly](http://transformation.blog.nhs.uk). And we [put our show and tells on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2PdPblHK2OE5UossmD88YQ).

On Tuesday we hosted the first cross NHS design get-together from Leeds, as a [brown bag lunchtime session](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brown-bag-meeting.asp).

We are trying to bring people interested in design together to talk about the design work we do in the NHS, the services we work on, and the way these services are created. Deliberately I have not said ‘designers’, focusing on bringing together a community that is interested in design.

We also want the time be one where people can be open and honest, to talk about their good stuff and the stuff that could be better.

Using a big screen, two Macbooks, a telephone people from our offices in Exeter, Leeds, Newcastle, and London “met” using Google Hangouts, WebEx, and a telephone call. It was a little faffy, but it just about worked. Matt Higgins took [a picture of us in action](https://twitter.com/matsquatch_11/status/775974922254487552).

I showed how we have been working and what we have been doing on nhs.uk, particularly out of Leeds. You can [see me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hamtweets/status/775659260843847680).

Ben Cullimore stepped forward to share the work the team he is in has been doing on the [e-Referral System](http://digital.nhs.uk/referrals). Ben gave a great, honest appraisal, and also had [one of my favourite slides](https://twitter.com/Hamtweets/status/775665856181309440) that I have seen while at the NHS.

It said:

Excellent advice.

‘Digital transformation’ is a phrase that is used often, and regularly focuses alone on the technology. While I am at the NHS I want to make sure the people, design as a thing, and ways of working aren’t missed as part of that. Those are what ‘digital’ means to me.

Thank you to everyone who made the time to take part and attend. We’ll be doing another meet in about a month’s time.
