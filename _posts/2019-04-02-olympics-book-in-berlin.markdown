Over on Kickstarter there's a project I've pledged to support, a [book on the design team for the 1972 Olympics](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/munich72/munich-72-the-visual-output-of-otl-aichers-dept-xi/description), Dept. XI.

It reminded me a month back we were over in Berlin for a week. On the desk in the hotel room was an excellent book on the [1976 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics). (The Olympics were in Montreal. 1972 was Munich. 1980 was Moscow. 1976? It's OK if you cannot remember. I had to look it up too.)

It was an Olympics with an excellent logo, even if it can look like an upside down stack of kitchen rolls. There's a page about the identity over on the [old We Made This website](https://wemadethis.typepad.com/we_made_this/2007/07/1976-olympic-lo.html), including [some scans from an old Design magazine](http://wemadethis.typepad.com/we_made_this/montreal-olympics-1976.html). And there's some more stuff about that Olympics' design manual on [ISO50](http://blog.iso50.com/29247/1976-olympics-graphics-manual/).

Anyway, the book was in German so my GCSE in German only helped me read it so much. But there were lots of pictures in the book to take in. Here's some pictures of the book.

Didn't note down what the book was though, did I.
