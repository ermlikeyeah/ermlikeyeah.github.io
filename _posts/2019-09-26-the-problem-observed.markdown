We live on a crescent. A crescent is a road that is a loop: You go into the crescent off a feeding road, go up one way, and if you keep going you will find yourself back where you started the loop.

At the midpoint of our crescent they are doing roadworks.

No car can pass, only turn around once they reach the roadworks. You only see the roadworks once you have gone round the curve of the crescent, which side of the crescent you go up. The “road closed” signs are right next to the road works. There is no other warning on the road.

Our house is very close to the roadworks. Outside our house there have been people driving along the road, unable to go further, and then having to do 180 degree turns, tight turns, on the road to go back the way they came.

I asked this morning if the signs could be moved further back along the street.

“No.”

I was also informed I am the third person to ask.

I said if people were informed of the situation sooner, they could make a decision what they need to do – do there and then when they see the warning or be prepared to do something a little later. I got a shrug back.

If anyone wants to know what I do for a living, it’s that conversation – there is a situation where a problem has been observed; is there something we can do to solve the problem?; here is a possible solution to the problem; could we implement this solution? –  around other scenarios, repeatedly. Sometimes people agree.

So now you know.
