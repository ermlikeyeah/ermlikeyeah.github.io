29 January 2016. Over [on the a16z podcast](http://pca.st/7zTx) _When banking works like my smartphone_. Taavet Hinrikus, CEO and co-founder of TransferWise, says:

> Purely by putting on some make up and a better front end you can't offer a fundamentally better service.

A couple of days back [on Medium](https://medium.com/@davidgtonge/why-mondo-will-blow-atom-out-of-the-water-a1d39924c310#.wfmvt2y34), _Atom is just “UX-ing” banking. Mondo is re-imagining it_:

> Disrupting finance shouldn’t be that difficult. All it takes is a ruthless focus on solving customers problems rather than selling them a product.

These are two that caught my eyes/ears recently. There's probably more.

I have written before on [people's expectancies](/design-is-the-process-and-when-designing-works), [designing and making egolessly](blood-simple) to meet users needs. If the skeleton is broken, if the systems that surround it are borked, then putting a new skin on it is just hiding the decay underneath.

Go right inside to the start, to the root, to the problem, and work inside out. If the banking industry realises this is the opportunity, well, so should anyone else offering a service.
