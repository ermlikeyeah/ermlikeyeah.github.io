I love looking out for signage.

Some signage I love because they delight me in some way. Like [signage in airports](/air-lines/) and [wheelchair signs in New York](/a-sense-of-doing-something/). Them are da best signs.

Here is another of my favourites, on an air hockey table at the Hollywood Bowl in Bradford.

Wonderful is it not?

Some signs make me scratch my head, like they are a puzzle, an enigma even.

Here is one of my “fave” head scratchers, close to where I live, turning out of Woodhouse Grove onto Harrogate Road.

The punchline is you see this sign as you drive into Woodhouse Grove not as you are driving out as you would actually need it.

If you are curious what the road map this is trying to show looks like, here you go (nabbed from [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.8376677,-1.7036211,17z)).

Out of sheer _I had both of those images open in Photoshop_-ness I comped the map onto the sign.

At least the landmarks make it a little easier to understand.

Anyway.
