Maps or models, eh. Is there a difference? What is the difference? Does it matter?

Early in the week I rejigged the layout of the desk in the shed, swapping the MacBook from being in the centre and the monitor to the side. Now the monitor is front and centre. With the greyer days this week I got the light back over the door and on most of the time. I've had some good days in the shed, and one great day. The move around helped, more space for my hands, pads and multiple mugs as I drink through the day.

I took a little time out to catch up with some friends in the industry and had a couple of mentoring sessions, organised through Mega Mentor. If you've not caught up with some friends recently, I recommend it! Do it! Send that message now! And if you're looking for mentorship, head to the Mega Mentor website. Other mentors are available.

I have views on being a mentor, seeking a mentor and having a mentor. This week I had a strong feeling as a mentor _sometimes_ when you talk with people they are waiting for you as a mentor to set them off, like you're a career advisor at school. Don't wait for the mentor to nudge you onwards. Do some of that yourself. Come along with an idea of something you've started already, something you're in the middle of. Maybe it is just the relationships I have had before but those feel the most engaging sessions, relationships even.

I finished the third season of the TV show Dark. Which means I have finished all of Dark. I watched the last few episodes in the shed because the constant rumble of thunder in the shower reduced the dog to a panty state, drool dripping onto the settee, carpet, and wherever gravity drew it towards. Dark was super good, even though there were a few involuntary flinches. So much cracking of skulls with rocks. ðŸ˜¬ I didn't need a map either. All in the head.

Sim City Build It got deleted off my iPad. I was enjoying it, developing the area, but... itâ€™d become like a Tamogotchi, check in every day, sometimes _a bit more_, occasionally _a bit bit more_. The whole repetitive nature of the cycle of making resources in the game wore me down. _Set that being made_ and _set that other thing being made_ so later I _collect that_ to _add to that other thing I got made_. And then add that with other things Iâ€™ve made to create buildings, as long as I have them all made already. Otherwise go back and _set another thing being made_. The ever expanding loops. It just became too tiresome, joyless, a joyless chore. I just want to watch my conurbation... happen, like I used to in earlier version of Sim City. I didn't get that feeling of a city growing without my interventions. So, deleted. Yeah, I'd sunk some time into it but so what? You got to draw the line somewhere. Plus the price of cheesecake in that city's economy oh boy. As a city mayor I wouldn't stand for cheesecake that expensive and I couldn't change it. Wrong.

The boy and I got our environment monitor up and running. [A kit from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171), a lower end Raspberry Pi, and some other bits and piece and we were away making it. (Thereâ€™s some really good instructions [on Pimoroniâ€™s website](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/enviro-plus-and-luftdaten-air-quality-station))

Weâ€™re now sharing environment data from the end of the garden (the monitor is attached to the shed). Tehnically weâ€™ve two sensors: sensor ID 47639, a particulate matter sensor (which reads like one of the subtitles from Dark), and sensor ID 47640, a temperature/humidity/pressure sensor. You can see them on [this map](https://maps.sensor.community/#6/51.165/10.455). I am enjoying see what our sensor thinks is the temperature and what Dark Skies reports it as. And making the data open feels good. I've really enjoyed making physical products/things again the last couple of weeks (I have also had some time to create a prototype device for a client with another Pi and a small touchscreen).

What have you been making recently?

I published [a run note for June](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/run-note-for-june-2020/). My running this week has been a bit off to be honest. Itâ€™s Friday and so far Iâ€™ve only been out on Tuesday. I wanted to give my leg a rest on Monday and Wednesday. Yesterday my legs felt a little pang. so rest again. Today the same, but I am gonna get out after I publish these and see where I go.

And finally July has snook up on me. My current work contract is up next month â€” next month! â€” so I am going to have to start looking and chatting. I've shared a few interesting roles the last few months but not really taken a moment to think "Is that for me?" I will be now. I've had a couple of chats already this week after sharing the news on Twitter and LinkedIn, and yes [my ten questions for a new role](https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/ten-questions-for-a-new-role/) were used. If you hear or know of anything that you think Iâ€™d be good at and/or interested in, let me know. Being good at the role and the role being interesting are definitely my two main acceptance criteria.
