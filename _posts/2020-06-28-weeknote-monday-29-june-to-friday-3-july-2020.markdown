I rejigged the layout of the desk in the shed, swapping the MacBook from being front and centre and the monitor to the side, so now the monitor is front and centre. With the greyer days this week I got the light back over the door and on most of the time. {% include image.html url="/assets/monitor-middle.jpg" description="The monitor in the middle" %}


The boy and I got our environment monitor up and running. [A kit from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171), a lower end Raspberry Pi, and some other bits and piece and we were away making it. (There’s some really good instructions [on Pimoroni’s website](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/enviro-plus-and-luftdaten-air-quality-station))

We’re now sharing environment data from the end of the garden (the monitor is attached to the shed). Tehnically we’ve two sensors, a particulate matter sensor (sensor ID 47639) and temperature/humidity/pressure sensor BME280 (sensor ID 47640). You can see them on [this map](https://maps.sensor.community/#6/51.165/10.455). I am enjoying see what our sensor thinks is the temperature and what Dark Skies reports it as. And I've really enjoyed making physical things again (I have also had some time to create a prototype device for a client).
