A great video this, that starts with something that reminds me of how I was taught the size and proximity of planets back in school: All the planets are massive and really close together, without making the point "this is for illustration purposes only".

These guys set out into the Nevada desert to create a *to scale model* of our solar system. Fun stuff!
