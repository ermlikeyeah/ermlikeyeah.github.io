My working week was basically continuing service mapping and then pausing it to get some artefacts/outputs done, "Maccing up" a journey map, gap analysis, and some catch ups with people elsewhere in "the industry". During the week my overriding rumination was _project or product, labourer or collaborator_?

A weekend of [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/2706544377) (with the dog), [climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Yy0-GHVGE/), football (Oldham's ground has [some lovely old type on one of it's oldest buildings](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ZceqInKKh/)), reading, [more running](https://www.strava.com/activities/2710148143) (this time without the dog), bowling, more climbing, and cooking.
