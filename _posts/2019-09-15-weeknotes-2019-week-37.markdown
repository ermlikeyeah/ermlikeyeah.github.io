One of those head down, keep at it working weeks: Continuing service mapping and then pausing it to get some artefacts/outputs done, "Maccing up" a journey map, gap analysis, some catch ups with people elsewhere in "the industry", and ending the week looking to look over something early next week. During the week my overriding ruminations were _Project or product?_ and _Labourer versus collaborator?_.

A weekend of [running](https://www.strava.com/activities/2706544377) (with the dog), [climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Yy0-GHVGE/), football (Oldham's ground has [some lovely old type on one of it's oldest buildings](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ZceqInKKh/)), reading, [more running](https://www.strava.com/activities/2710148143) (this time without the dog), bowling, more climbing, and cooking.
