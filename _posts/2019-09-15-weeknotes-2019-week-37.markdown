My working week was basically continuing and then pausing service mapping, "Maccing up" a journey map, gap analysis, and catch ups with people elsewhere in "the industry". During the week my overriding mediation was _project or product, doer or collaborator_?

A weekend of running, climbing, football, reading, more running, bowling, more climbing, and cooking.
