In New York the other day I spotted a sign for wheelchair access to a school.

![New wheelchair symbol](/assets/new-york-wheelchair-access-sign.jpg)

I love it showing people in wheelchairs _doing something_ from the icon, even if it only seems to represent physical movement. I appreciate that not everyone in a wheelchair has as much physical control. Compare to the more established, more static [International Symbol of Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Symbol_of_Access). People in wheelchairs can do versus a sense of being immobile.

Two interesting things came out of posting this picture on Twitter:

1. [Mark Morton](https://twitter.com/PontoonDock) made me aware he “got management to use this sign when we repainted the disabled parking spaces at work”. Mark also pointed me in the direction of [The Accessible Icon Project](http://accessibleicon.org), with some background on the symbol and also the chance to [buy stickers and stencils of the icon](http://accessibleicon.org/#buy). The revised symbol was born out of hacking existing signs with stickers. Well worth a read.

2. A little later [Ariel Kennan](https://twitter.com/arielmai) gave me a heads up to [an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/07/29/the-handicap-symbol-gets-an-update-at-least-in-new-york-state/?utm_term=.25089db3a3bb) with the background to this symbol being used in New York (where I saw it). Basically using this symbol is the law in New York state.

All interesting stuff.
