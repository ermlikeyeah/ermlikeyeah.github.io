We are staying at Skegness Butlins.

I've got stuff to do while we are here. That stuff is on a computer. I'll need to send stuff. I will need to access the wifi.

Using my iPhone I connect to the wifi. I need to choose an option.

1. Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi
2. Use a voucher code to connect to the wifi
3. Pay as you go for the wifi
4. I've pre-paid for the wifi

I don't know how 2 and 4 compare, but I haven't bought any internet access. And I am going to need more than half an hour today, and more over the weekend. I plump for 3.

I read the page. I choose a "tariff" (Â£15 for four days), give some details (name, home address, email address), and go to the next screen. I provide some payment details. I click submit. Job done.

I then decide to connect my Macbook to the wifi. I get the same four options.

1. Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi
2. Use a voucher code to connect to the wifi
3. Pay as you go for the wifi
4. I've pre-paid for the wifi

Ah. I must have just bought a voucher code to connect to the internet. I click the option.

In smaller type I see `Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.`

I open my email on the phone. I look at the email from Virgin, the wifi provider. I cannot clearly see a "voucher code". I look again. Nope. Nothing. Hmmm.

I go back a page. I take in the options.

Maybe it is option 4:  I've pre-paid for the wifi.

Nope. And again `Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.`

I go back to the options.

I click on option 1: Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi. This doesn't tell me the service is not transferable. But also this option is for limited access does not requires a financial transaction.

I revisit option 3: Pay as you go for the wifi. Maybe I missed the `Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.` I didn't.

I have did grabs of the screens.

Anyway. That exclusion of `Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.` feels pretty sneaky. Humph.
