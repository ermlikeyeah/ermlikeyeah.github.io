[Matt Jukes](https://twitter.com/jukesie) wrote a brilliant, really [brilliant piece on culture and hiring](https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-is-a-team-sport-c50d234745e#.3gaxom9p0) to supplement his recent [Design Swansea](http://designswansea.org.uk) talk. Put the time aside and read it.

The a16z podcast consistently sticks out the most fascinating listens. Their recent episode, Politics Over Pragmatism, is in that bracket. Get it through iTunes or Pocket Casts or whatever you use to listen to podcasts - or [you can listen online](http://a16z.com/2016/06/04/dc-china-trump-guns-tech-politics-socioeconomics/). Running time: about 45 minutes.

Finally, there's [a sweet little piece about Product v Craft](https://medium.com/ustwo/development-product-vs-craft-974c4d1a0180#.3yym7olfn) from [Juan Delgado](https://twitter.com/wadus) at ustwo.
