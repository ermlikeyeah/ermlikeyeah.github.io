It was a privilege to be asked to speak at [Forefront Leeds](forefront.cc/forefront-no9-november-25th-at-the-belgrave/) last night – almost a year on from when [I last talked at the event](http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/).

It's never a problem to support the work [Russ Poulter](https://twitter.com/russpoulter) and [Chris Kemm](https://twitter.com/chriskemm) put into pulling the event together by saying yes to their invites, putting the time in to write a talk, and then deliver it on the night – especially alongside two other engrossing talks from [Alex](https://twitter.com/webbist) and [Becs](https://twitter.com/becskr). I loved the breadth of topics and touchpoints, especially Alex showing off [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) and Becs reminding me of the [overly happy emails I get from Virgin Trains](https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/669049621231091715).

There's always an open-minded and engaged crowd at Forefront, which makes talks a little more leftfield-than-usual easier to give. So, equally good work from those that came along, and enjoyed/endured my talk.

Also great to have the chance to leg it back and talk in Leeds, where I spent many years working. Hopefully I gave something back to the city, hopefully a little more than cheap laughs.

Forefront is one of a number of brilliant design and tech events in the area that have appeared over the past five or so years. The city has a strong, more open, more visible scene these days. Long may that continue.

Thank you all.
