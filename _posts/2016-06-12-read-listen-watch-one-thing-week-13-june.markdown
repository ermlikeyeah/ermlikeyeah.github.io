Nothing noted yet.

The follow-up to the sad news about Jo Law's death was a lot of writing. One piece that caught my eye was [in the Evening Standard]( http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/allegra-stratton-on-jo-coxs-boat-we-drank-wine-and-talked-pink-toys-family-life-and-the-refugee-a3274441.html), a tribute from Allegra Stratton.

> Not long after being elected she approached Former development secretary Andrew Mitchell: “I was a wicked old Tory,” he told me, “but I’d written about needing to do more with Assad. We co-wrote an article and I said, ‘you do realise you’re going out on a limb here’ but she was fearless. She just wanted to do the right thing.”

Be unusual. Do the right thing.
