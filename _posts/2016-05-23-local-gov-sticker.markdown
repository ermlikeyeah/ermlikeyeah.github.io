Exactly a month back [I posted on the brave and hard work](/bradford-gov-uk/) being done by the team at Bradford council to create a new digital platform.

After the team took the time to show me their progress, being done in the right way, I pulled together a quick sticker design (borrowing from the set-up in gov) and sent it off to print as a thank you.

Pulling together the artwork I was reminded of Bradford's motto:

> Progress. Industry. Humanity.

On gov stickers we carry the motto "Trust. Users. Delivery." While Bradford council's digital platform team had been inspired by the work in government, the city's motto seemed a more than apt replacement.

And because the team have been going about work the right way, a tick seemed a good mark, a positive indicator. Well done! Keep doing this! (Plus, I am rubbish at drawing thumbs ups so, y'know...)

I also got them printed onto shiny gold. Because everyone likes a shiny.

Here's the stickers.

This morning, the council's senior technology officer David Cawthray [tweeted me]( https://twitter.com/DavidCawthray/status/734653159482757120). The stickers had arrived! Good to see! David and everyone else who worked hard on the council's platform deserve them. As a Bradford citizen it is still amazing they worked the way they did to make what they did. And they are still going!

As a believer of working in the open, I've uploaded the artwork for the sticker for anyone else who could make use of it.

Two conditions:

1. You have worked on a digital service in the right way (either to meet the [government digital by default service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default), the [local gov standard](http://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/local-government-digital-service-standard/), or an equivalent) – and it's out there.
2. You can only have a sticker if you have earned it. These are not for promotional purposes. Stick them and show them off with pride.

The artwork is set to size (45mm/4.5cm) and if you want a printer I recommend [Diginate](http://www.diginate.com) or [Awesome Merch](http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/Circular-45mm-Vinyl-Stickers). You want circular stickers and a matt finish.

[Get the artwork here](/assets/bradford-beta-launch.pdf). It's a PDF, which can be opened in Adobe Illustrator. You can alter the words and colours easy enough.

And if you do make use of this artwork, [let me know](/contact)!
