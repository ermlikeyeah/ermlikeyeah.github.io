How’s homeschooling been going for you?

Things heated up at my end a few weeks back when the amount of the boy’s schoolwork increased. We got access to an email address we could access online through Outlook, which led to access to Microsoft Teams. Then came a Trello board. Then access to Seneca. And then other things. As each subject getting in touch separately with their process we were learning _the what_, _the how_ and _the when_ as we went along. I started to map it all lightly.

1. For each subject, how does the boy find out what work he has been set?
2. Where and how does he do the work? (Online: What system? Offline?)
3. Support: What if the boy needs to talk to his teacher/s about the work?
4. Submission: How is the work sent to the teacher/s?
5. Feedback: How did he get on?

A series of digital tools for getting the work and knowing where to look was one thing.

If the boy was at school he would have been in a lesson in a classroom, noted down the details of any work in his journal and planned from that. It wasn’t perfect. We always had to check he wasn’t leaving it all to the last minute. _Where is that sheet he needs to do the work?_ still happens in secondary school. But there was a process, a system even, and the journal was the record of his mind processing what was needed.

Gathering and analysis can be overlooked when we rush to digitalise processes. Long lists of _things to do_ don't help you as a person work through what you need to do and when by. You still need to order it. This can be overwhelming if you are giving most things or every thing all at once.

To help with this at the start of the week we have s all session with a sticky note for every subject the boy studies. We look through the systems the lessons use and see what is needed. This means a look at — and that means a good look over — the work set. We see what is needed and write onto each subject sticky note:

1. The subject.
2. A brief description of the work. Not “work on Trello” but a brisk overview of the work, like “answer questions about rap”.
3. Any deadline (sometimes there is a time on a day not just a day).

Looking over the work gives us a rough idea of the size of the work, which we don't record because it'd make the sticky notes too busy. We then put the stickies onto a sheet of A3, with a row for each day of the week. We try to have three subjects for each day, sometimes one or two more if they're "smaller" pieces of work. As they are sticky notes we ca move them around as much as we like.

As we go through anything that is needed beyond the current week we place to the left of the paper, _for later_. As work is done the boy moves them over to the right of the paper, _done_, complete with _a green tick_ because he thinks green is _a positive colour_ that _shows movement_.

What subjects go where? That is very much down to the boy's choosing, but a contributory factor is spreading about the lessons he likes less so there is no build up of them on any one day.

At the start of the day the boy takes the sticky notes and puts them on a picture frame. As the sticky notes are removed and placed under _done_ on the fridge a message is revealed: _No More Work_.
