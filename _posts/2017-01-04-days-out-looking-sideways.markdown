title: Days out looking sideways

In late November I wrote about [looking sideways more](/look-sideways-more/). I suggested it’s a thing that you should look into doing a bit more – because I find it the kind of thing that’s useful.

As 2017 kicks off I find myself with a chance to do a bit more of that: I’ve gotta take some days off away from [NHS Beta](//transformation.blog.nhs.uk) between now and the end of March.

There’s half term in the middle of February, so some family time there. But, other than that? Well, my wife has a job that keeps her busy during the week. And my kids are old enough they have their own lives. And if those guys aren’t free? That leaves a few other days left I need to take.

I could just fill the time with… stuff. But I’ve spent enough time over the years filling time, and doing nothing. I hate it.

And, on the flip side, I love the work I do these days.

So, here’s an offer: I will gladly use some of those days off for me to look sideways, to nip in and spend time with other work happening across public services – and maybe me being there will be a look sideways for you too.

I’m up for owt, whether it’s help with the work you’re doing, general cheerleading about design, or showing up to give you a moral boost. It’s 9.40pm as I end tapping this. An hour-and-a-half ago I made this offer and already have a couple of days planned in. If you’ll have me just [drop me a line](/contact).
