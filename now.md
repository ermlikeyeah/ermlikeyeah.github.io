## Work

Currently I am mainly contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) on the NHS Jobs project at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk), until May 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I write [week notes](/tags/#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags/#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services. I am organising the next [Leeds Gov Design](/leedsgovdesign) meet for early April 2020.

My upcoming speaking engagements:

* A public one, on accessible products and services, at the next Product People North, Friday 15 May 2020
* A private one, on my running adventures in 2019

If you are interested in me doing a session at your place of work or event, please get in touch.

I am planning on being at the following events. If you see me I am always happy to say hi and have a chat, so pleased do! If you are planning on going to one of these events and fancy a longer chat feel free to get in touch ahead of the event and we can see what we can do.

* [Service Design in Government](https://2020.govservicedesign.net), Edinburgh, Thursday 5 March 2020 only (not there the Wednesday and Friday)
* [Disruption Summit](https://disruptionsummit.co.uk/), Leeds, Tuesday 24 March 2020
* [Up Front](https://upfrontconf.com), Manchester, Friday 27 March 2020
* [Camp Digital](https://www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/2020/), Manchester, Wednersday 13 May 2020

I currently have no spare time to take on any further "full time" mentoring. Sorry. Three people is as many as I can help at the mo. If you just need an hour to chat with someone about work I could squeeze something in though.

If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
