## Work

Currently I am mainly contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk) on the NHS Jobs project and Covid-19 responses, until May 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I write [week notes](/tags#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services.

My upcoming speaking engagements:

* A public one, on accessible and inclusive products and services, at the next Product People North, Friday 15 May 2020
* A private one, on my running adventures during 2019

If you are interested in me doing a session at your place of work or event, please get in touch. If you have something specific in mind that is a good start too.

I currently have no spare time to take on any further "full time" mentoring. Sorry. Three people is as many as I can help at the mo. If you just need an hour to chat with someone about work I could squeeze something in though.

If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
