## Work

Currently I am mainly contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk) on the new NHS Jobs and Covid-19 responses, until the summer 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I write [week notes](/tags#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services.

I have no upcoming speaking engagements. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like me to do something. If you have something specific in mind that is a good start too.

I offer up time to mentor through Mega Mentor. Check out [their website](https://mega-mentor.com) and the other mentors too.

If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
