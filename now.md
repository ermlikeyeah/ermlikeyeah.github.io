## Work

Currently I am contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) on the NHS Jobs project at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk), until May 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I write [week notes](/tags/#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags/#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services. I am organising the next [Leeds Gov Design](/leedsgovdesign) meet for early April 2020.

I have two upcoming speaking engagements:

* A private one, on my running adventures in 2019
* A public one, on accessible products and services, at the next Product People North in May 2020

I currently have no spare time to take on any further mentoring. Sorry.

If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
