## Work

I have left my studio head and board room life behind and these days work as a freelancer, usually doing service or product work (usually designing), eulogising-through-coaching agile ways of working, _sometimes_ helping look at operations stuff.

Currently I am mainly contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk) on the new NHS Jobs and Covid-19 responses, until the summer 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I try to write [week notes](/tags#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services.

I have no upcoming speaking engagements. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like me to do something. If you have something specific in mind that is a good start too.

I offer up time to mentor through Mega Mentor. Do you need a mentor? Could you be a mentor? Check out [the Mega Mentor website](https://mega-mentor.com) and all the mentors offering their time.

If you think I might be able to help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
