## Work

Currently I am contracting as a service designer for [Difrent](//difrent.co.uk) on the NHS Jobs project at [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk), until May 2020. I am [figuring out what I will be doing after that date](/work-note-2020-january/).

I write [week notes](/tags/#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags/#work%20notes).

I coordinate the [Leeds gov design meets](/leedsgovdesign/), a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services. I am organising the next [Leeds Gov Design](/leedsgovdesign) meet for early April 2020.

I have two upcoming speaking engagements:

* A private one, on my running adventures in 2019
* A public one, on accessible products and services, at the next Product People North in May 2020

I currently have no spare time to take on any further "full time" mentoring. Sorry. These people is enough at the no. If you just need an hour to chat with someone about work I could squeeze something in though. 

If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
