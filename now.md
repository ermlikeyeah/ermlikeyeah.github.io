## Work

I have left my studio head and board room life behind and these days work as a freelancer, usually doing service or product work (usually designing), _sometimes_ helping look at operations stuff.

I am currently helping [create/change](//createchange.io) and the Ministry of Justice as a product manager. I am contracted until early February 2023 and currently available after that.

I try to write [week notes](/tags#weeknotes) which sometimes mention work and a more specific [monthly work note](/tags#work%20notes).

When time allows I [offer up half hour spaces in my diary](http://calendly.com/officeofwilson/catch-up), a chance to say hi, catch up or talk about a problem.

When time allows too I offer up time to mentor through Mega Mentor. Do you need a mentor? Could you be a mentor? Check out [the Mega Mentor website](https://mega-mentor.com) and all the mentors offering their time.

I have no upcoming speaking engagements. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like me to do something. If you have something specific in mind that is a good start too.

If you think I might be able to help you or your organisation please [get in touch](/contact).
