### Keep it real

— Realise ideas: Make actual, tangible things<br>
— Stay grounded<br>
— Don’t work with assholes<br>
— Be adaptable: Things change<br>
— Be a good ally; Call out bad behaviour<br>

### Be open minded

— Share whenever possible, as much as possible<br>
— Borrow wherever appropriate (and feedback how useful it was)<br>
— Have strong ideas loosely held<br>
— Ideas can come from anywhere<br>
— Be open to construvtive criticism<br>

### Always make progress

— Movement forward can be small or large, but keep that momentum going

### Be proud

— Do good work<br>
— Be proud of the work, but not to the detriment of inclusive working<br>
— Be an example to others
