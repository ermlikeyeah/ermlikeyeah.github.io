I"™<p>Every year, about this time of the year, I do talks to students about the agency business, what itâ€™s like, what I do, how I got into â€œthe bizâ€, and offer up some hints and tips to help them at least get some experience in some form.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s this yearâ€™s base presentation. It should tell the narrative. Thereâ€™s a couple of things I say that are not in the slides, notably the thought of going into agencies isnâ€™t the only career path - and maybe consider doing something else altogether, even if it is setting your own thing up. In the main it should be self explanatory.</p>

<p>(If youâ€™re someone who has seen this and it was slightly different I may have edited it a touch before I presented it.)</p>
