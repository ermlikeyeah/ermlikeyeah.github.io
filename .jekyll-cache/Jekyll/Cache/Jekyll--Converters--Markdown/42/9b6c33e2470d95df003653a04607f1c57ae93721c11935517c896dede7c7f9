I"ó<p>A couple of weeks back I shared <a href="/let-go/">Iâ€™d been let go from my job</a>. I signed off not saying what exactly I was doing next. I was unsure, and a little mentally punchdrunk - being let go wasnâ€™t something I was expecting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/">Prolific North</a> got in touch at the time quite quickly, and wanted to run the story of me leaving - and were <em>going</em> to run that story. So I offered up some words, floated the vague idea of â€œdoing my own thingâ€, without any real idea of what that was going to be, and <a href="http://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/2014/03/simon-wilson-to-become-consultant-after-unexpected-departure-from-home/">they ran the story</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/2013/04/simon-wilson-steps-down-from-the-bloom-board/">When I left Bloom a year back</a> I was already mentally ready for leaving. When I left Home I thought I wasnâ€™t prepared. But reading <a href="/let-go/">my previous post</a> again I realise I probably was. I had become tired/frustrated mending/rebooting someone elseâ€™s thing again - and it shows in that blog post.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve decided to go â€œdo my own thingâ€ as I said, and start off by doing â€˜freelanceâ€™, â€˜contractâ€™, or â€˜consultâ€™, or whatever phrase you want to describe someone who is paid to come into somewhere temporarily or for a fixed amount of time, be it â€œjust a dayâ€, â€œseveral days a week for the next few monthsâ€, or â€œfrom now, every day, for the next two monthsâ€. Do that to start things off and see where the wind takes me.</p>

<p>I am going to concentrate on the strategy and UX side of digital work/projects (because, to me, strategy and UX are linked). Being focused on researching audiences - their habits, needs, what they donâ€™t realise - and understanding how that can flow into the resultant user experience to engage people with technology-driven experiences has always fascinated me. (Iâ€™m not talking cyborgs here. Yet.) And Iâ€™ll be able to do it directly, face-to-face, not hidden away â€œback at the officeâ€ or â€œin a room with the rest of the geeksâ€.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not about <em>digital</em> for me, or <em>online</em> and/or/versus <em>offline</em> - itâ€™s about experiences that are part of our modern existence. I just happen to be more interested in how digital facilitates that.</p>

<p>Not being tied to a full time role in someone elseâ€™s business gives me the space to do more R&amp;D focused digital stuff as well, and Iâ€™ve already a couple of things bubbling under which could prove to be promising enough to apply for grant support for. And putting a little time aside during my working week to help out with bodies like <a href="http://www.leedsdatamill.org/">Leeds Data Mill</a> - thatâ€™ll all be my choice.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll continue teaching and lecturing, and even a little training - because I enjoy spreading the word!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had people in touch about offering them business advice, if I can look over the way their businesses work. With 12 of my 14 years in agency life looking after and running studio functions, creative departments, and also for a year pseudo-running an agency those people have wanted to tap into that. Thatâ€™s fine. But I wonâ€™t be doing that full time. If I did Iâ€™d be back full time somewhere. But I donâ€™t fancy that.</p>

<p>I want to spend most of my time getting on with researching, understanding problems, and working to solve those: ideas for what can be done and then getting on with making a solution, a product, a service.</p>

<p>The chance to work with a few different folk in new environments, not just the agency ones Iâ€™ve been tied to the past 14 years is massively alluring. Studios. Technology companies. Academic institutions. Public bodies. Whoever. Wherever. Thatâ€™s exciting!</p>

<p>And the bits I donâ€™t specialise on? Itâ€™s not a one person show. Iâ€™ve got a great network of people who can help me collaboratively, and want to be on the case as well!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be putting work through a business called <a href="http://www.studioofthings.com/">Things</a>, because that what I want to make: <em>things</em>. (Iâ€™ll blog on the name and identity another time.)</p>

<p>Which all means this shop is now open. Better go and find some more work!</p>
