I"<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation">Digital transformation</a> isn’t about making websites.</p>

<p>It isn’t just about “putting the forms online”.</p>

<p>It isn’t just about “putting the forms online” and leaving the rest of the user journey, the service untouched.</p>

<p>It isn’t about accepting, about allowing an oligopoly of a service to excuse “something is better than nothing”.</p>

<p>It is about expectancy. It is about moving towards what people expect from services as <em>normal, everyday</em>.</p>

<p>And we live in a world where things move fast, things happen fast, things progress fast.</p>

<p>Digital transformation is about transformation full stop.</p>

<p>When you’re behind already you’ve gotta catch up. You’ve got to be, you’ve got to keep things simple, clear, fast.</p>

<p>Reached this point thinking “That’s obvious, that”? You’re right. It is. But that doesn’t mean the obvious is always in sight, let alone done.</p>

<p>My good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/pajefferies">Phil Jefferies</a> frequently says “There is nothing that the application of logic cannot solve.”</p>

<p>If you’re involved with transformation do the obvious: Be logical.</p>

<p>Transform, design based on the needs of those using the service you’re involved with. Don’t be selfish, don’t design driven by your ego.</p>

<p>I’ve got a job for you: Deal in facts. Make your services as they are needed. Make it simple. Make it clear. Make it fast. Make it egoless. Obvious, innit.</p>
