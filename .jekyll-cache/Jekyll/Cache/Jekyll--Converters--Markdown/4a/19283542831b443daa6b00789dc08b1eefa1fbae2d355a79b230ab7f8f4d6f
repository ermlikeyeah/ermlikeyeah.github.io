I"Ó<p>Just before Christmas I did some posters at work that said â€œContinual Gradual Improvementâ€. (Grind â€˜til we shine and all that, yeah?) I opened Illustrator, laid this is out (pretty roughly), printed it a few times on A3, and hung them - all in the last hour of work before Christmas.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an A4 print of it, on my desk at home.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/continual-gradual-improvement-shot.jpg" alt="The Continual Gradual Improvement poster on my study desk. Out of shot is all the shit I don't want you to see." /></p>

<p>A couple of people have asked if they can have it as a PDF, so while I was sorting that I thought Iâ€™d make it more widely available.</p>

<p>Get it as <a href="/assets/continual gradual improvement - a4 - artwork.pdf">a PDF</a> (which will scale fine to A3) or <a href="/assets/continual gradual improvement - 3200px - screen.jpg">a JPG</a>.</p>

<p>And if you stick it up somewhere, maybe <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>
