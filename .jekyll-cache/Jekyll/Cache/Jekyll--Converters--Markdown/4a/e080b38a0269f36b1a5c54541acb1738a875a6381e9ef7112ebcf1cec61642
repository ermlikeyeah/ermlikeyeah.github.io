I"æ<p>The first Bradford CoderDojo of 2018 is on Saturday 27 January.</p>

<p>Basically, we give our time to help your kids make stuff with computers so those kids can help other kids make stuff with computers. And maybe help parents too. Itâ€™s free. Come along!</p>

<p>You can book a space through <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bradford-coderdojo-january-2018-tickets-41754813772?aff=es2">Eventbrite</a>. More information about the dojos are on the <a href="https://bradford-coderdojo.github.io">Bradford CoderDojo website</a>.</p>
