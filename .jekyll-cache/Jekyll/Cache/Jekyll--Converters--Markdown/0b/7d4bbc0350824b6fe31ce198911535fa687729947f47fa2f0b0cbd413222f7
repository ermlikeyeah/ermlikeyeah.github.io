I"˜
<p>Exactly a month back <a href="/bradford-gov-uk/">I posted on the brave and hard work</a> being done by the team at Bradford council to create a new digital platform.</p>

<p>After the team took the time to show me their progress, being done in the right way, I pulled together a quick sticker design (borrowing from the set-up in gov) and sent it off to print as a thank you.</p>

<p>Pulling together the artwork I was reminded of Bradford‚Äôs motto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Progress. Industry. Humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On gov stickers we carry the motto ‚ÄúTrust. Users. Delivery.‚Äù While Bradford council‚Äôs digital platform team had been inspired by the work in government, the city‚Äôs motto seemed a more than apt replacement.</p>

<p>And because the team have been going about work the right way, a tick seemed a good mark, a positive indicator. Well done! Keep doing this! (Plus, I am rubbish at drawing thumbs ups so, y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>I also got them printed onto shiny gold. Because everyone likes a shiny.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the stickers.</p>

<p>This morning, the council‚Äôs senior technology officer David Cawthray <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidCawthray/status/734653159482757120">tweeted me</a>. The stickers had arrived! Good to see! David and everyone else who worked hard on the council‚Äôs platform deserve them. As a Bradford citizen it is still amazing they worked the way they did to make what they did. And they are still going!</p>

<p>As a believer of working in the open, I‚Äôve uploaded the artwork for the sticker for anyone else who could make use of it.</p>

<p>Two conditions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have worked on a digital service in the right way (either to meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">government digital by default service standard</a>, the <a href="http://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/local-government-digital-service-standard/">local gov standard</a>, or an equivalent) ‚Äì and it‚Äôs out there.</li>
  <li>You can only have a sticker if you have earned it. These are not for promotional purposes. Stick them and show them off with pride.</li>
</ol>

<p>The artwork is set to size (45mm/4.5cm) and if you want a printer I recommend <a href="http://www.diginate.com">Diginate</a> or <a href="http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/Circular-45mm-Vinyl-Stickers">Awesome Merch</a>. You want circular stickers and a matt finish.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/bradford-beta-launch.pdf">Get the artwork here</a>. It‚Äôs a PDF, which can be opened in Adobe Illustrator. You can alter the words and colours easy enough.</p>

<p>And if you do make use of this artwork, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>!</p>
