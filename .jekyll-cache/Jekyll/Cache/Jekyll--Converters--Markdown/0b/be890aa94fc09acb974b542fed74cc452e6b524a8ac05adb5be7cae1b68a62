I"Ü<p>Iâ€™ve started looking at using <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk">AirBnB</a> a bit more for my travels. This week Iâ€™ve only really had a good poke around <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk">their website</a>. Previously Iâ€™d spent my time browsing AirBnB through their mobile apps.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of neat â€“ and read â€˜neatâ€™ as â€˜usefulâ€™ as well as â€˜tidyâ€™ â€“ user interface stuff on there. Well worth checking out.</p>

<p>One bit really caught my eye: The design of the page for the spaces you are looking at maybe booking.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a grab of a the bulk of a space page.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of content in there: Pictures are used to show the spaces off, and the rest relies on words. A lot of it relies on words. Thereâ€™s some titled icons in there to help break things up, again neatly, but thereâ€™s a lot of words. And thereâ€™s a neat trick employed to cut the number of words down â€“ and allow the user to bring more content into play when needed. Some good use of space, by the way. Not sure if there is a pun here, design or otherwise.</p>

<p>The layout just feels tidy. It just feelsâ€¦ neat.</p>

<p>Part of that neatness comes down to the Amenities section. AirBnB offers you spaces in peopleâ€™s homes. Sometimes youâ€™ll be browsing their whole home, other times just a room with access to some facilities. Pictures are all good and well, but what do you have access to?</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s that.</p>

<p>Again, neat, tidy, and kept to a 2x2 grid. Neater still is when you click <strong>More</strong>. The site reveals a list of <em>all the options</em>, with the relevant ones using bolder type and an icon, and the non-relevant struck-out and with less bolder weight.</p>

<p>Showing all the options. Showing what you get â€“ and then showing what you donâ€™t get. No ambiguity. Clear isnâ€™t it?</p>
