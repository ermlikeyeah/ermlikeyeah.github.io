I"m<p>A week or so back <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaRish/">Rishi Dastidar</a> shared a great copy led ad for <a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/">the Southbank Centre</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaRish/status/651027567663779840">on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>About the same time an excellent piece on the state of copywriting by Paul Burke popped up on <a href="http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/write-now-lost-art-copywriting/1367331">Campaign’s website</a>. Take five minutes out and read <a href="http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/write-now-lost-art-copywriting/1367331">the piece</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve said before I’d take a copywriter over an art director (albeit only <em>just</em>), and the two reference points nails pretty much of why.</p>

<p>The only tweak would be to Burke’s point <em>Copywriting was taught in schools</em>.</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve heard a few times “People learn English at school… So everyone is a copywriter” as an excuse to avoid getting a “proper writer” on the case – or even in the building. I am all for people having a go, showing their “other skills” – but there are times when the process of making needs specialist attention.</p>

<p>If we want a deeper reason why copywriting is a lost art, maybe there’s a root cause.</p>
