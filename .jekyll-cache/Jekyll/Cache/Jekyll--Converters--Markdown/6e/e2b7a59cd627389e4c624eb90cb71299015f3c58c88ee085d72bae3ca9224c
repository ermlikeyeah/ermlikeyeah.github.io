I"É<p>One weekend back in August I was slumped in a chair in a front room a short drive from Washington DC catching the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM-Wr8oqeYk">Jimmy Fallon square off with David Chang for a hot wing eating contest</a>. Changâ€™s one of those guys that <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/09/26/david-chang-broke-all-the-rules/">I find fascinating</a>.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a great talk from the recent WIRED By Design event of Chang <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/david-chang-shares-secrets-behind-momofukus-delicious-success/">talking about making deliciousness</a>. Changâ€™s talk focuses around cooking, but you can replace â€˜cookingâ€™ with whatever field you work in. The talkâ€™s really about leadership, creativity, and allowing creation to happen - and thereâ€™s a nice little nod in there towards everyone in an organisation being business savvy. (Otherwise what is the point?)</p>

<p>Also, deliciousness, eh! What a great word!</p>
