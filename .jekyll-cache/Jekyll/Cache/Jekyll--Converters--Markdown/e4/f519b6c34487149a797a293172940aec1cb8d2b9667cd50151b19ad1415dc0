I"ƒ<p>I had a quick half hour at the weekend to pull together a quick thing that sits between two big databases. Normally Iâ€™d call this a â€œhackâ€, but some of you might think that suggests something illegal. No laws were broken in the making of this thing! If we have to jargonise it letâ€™s call it a â€œdata linkerâ€.</p>

<p>I have a lot of time and curiosity for libraries. Amazing places with amazing resources. Thereâ€™s some interesting debates about the role libraries can play within society now and forwards.</p>

<p>At their most base libraries are delivery mechanisms for books, books from an archive.</p>

<p>A few friends recently have said theyâ€™re off on holiday, and theyâ€™ll take a book with them. How? Theyâ€™ll see whatâ€™s â€œpopularâ€. Going on holiday is a time to unwind, not time for books on â€œmanagement and all thatâ€. Itâ€™s about escapism. So they look up the top sellers, in the weekend papers, at Waterstones, on Amazon.</p>

<p>Some of those friends are also â€œwatching the penniesâ€, so regularly go to their local library.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I wanted to see if I could link a list of â€œpopularâ€ books and make easier the process of looking up that book in a library database.</p>

<p>And: I only had half an hour to do it while the potatoes cooked.</p>

<p>A quick scoot on Waterstones website found nothing easy I could refer to, but Amazon provide RSS feeds for some of their bestseller lists. This gives us data we can look at.</p>

<p>The Amazon data itself just gives me the top ten, and within that data are a few bits we can pull out (with a little jiggery pokery), like the ISBN number of the book and whether it is an ebook.</p>

<p>I live in Bradford and I work in Leeds, so if I can serve both areas, great. A check on both councilsâ€™ websites shows they use the same system for an web-based catalogue of their books, meaning what I used for one councilâ€™s libraries I could use for the other cityâ€™s. And after a little exploring I found I can feed a search into that system by ISBN number.</p>

<p>So, I wrote a quick tool that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reads an Amazon bestseller list</li>
  <li>Pulls out the bookâ€™s name, ISBN number, and whether it is an ebook</li>
  <li>Creates a link to the Leeds/Bradford library web service to allow the user to look up that book on the council system</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing massive. It took my half an hour to do this, with fifteen minutes a little later to add in several more lists beyond the â€œtop bestsellersâ€. You can see it at <a href="//www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-bestsellers.php">www.studioofthings.com/books/amazon-bestsellers.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty more I could do around and on top of this.</p>

<p>For example: It doesnâ€™t look that great.</p>

<p>Another example: At the moment my data linker doesnâ€™t say if the book is available in the library system or not. Can the list actually say â€œthis book in unavailableâ€ instead of the user having to click?</p>

<p>Yet another example: Can I link this to other websitesâ€™ data, other than just Amazonâ€™s?</p>

<p>And another example: Could it create an aggregate â€œtopâ€ list from a number of sources?</p>

<p>It has scope to do more, but in half an hour it does a job.</p>

<p>What else do you think it could do?</p>
