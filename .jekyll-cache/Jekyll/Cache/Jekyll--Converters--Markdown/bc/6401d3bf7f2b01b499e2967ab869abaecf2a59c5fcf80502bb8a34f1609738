<p><a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-number-2">Previously I left off</a> feeling disappointed and uncertain having not been told the outcome of my test results on Friday as planned, having seen the diabetes nurse previously on Tuesday 3 March.</p>

<p>Yesterday I remembered I could access my test results using SystmOnline, the system my GP practice uses.</p>

<p>I accessed the system and found my test results had been returned.</p>

<p>The commentary on the page showed the results had been reviewed and filed on Wednesday 4 March, the day after I saw the diabetes nurse.</p>

<p>Most of the results were within in the OK range. The one the doctor and I have been keeping an eye on is my haemoglobin levels. This was at 51. This was up on my previous test last summer. (I have <a href="https://www.icloud.com/numbers/02wb223nySZ6XmUED4XcJQWzw#blood">a spreadsheet</a> where I save my results as I get them, all in one place.)</p>

<p>Back at the top of the page there is the narrative (albeit not that clear) <em>What you need to do: No Further Action</em>.</p>

<p>Having gone from a doctor appointment where the doctor set up the appointment with the diabetes nurse <em>to see what further we can do,</em> the online system shows the outcome of the tests as there is <em>no further action</em>. I feel confused. The doctor was sure we would need to do more. This page says no need. Do I need to actually do anything? Is this why I didn’t get the call on Friday? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Yesterday the not-knowing hung over me. But today I am a shrug. I am confused, but I <em>don’t know</em>. I like working with uncertainty, but I don’t like living with troo much uncertainty. I like to live with facts. I am in the corridor of undertainty, <em>a hole</em> in a service. It is the sort of thing we would mark as a pain point on an experience map. But today there is nothing I can do. Tomorrow I am just going to ring the doctor’s surgery. I’ll feel like I am possibly imposing. I won’t be calling at 8am, but I will be later on in the morning. I need to just know what I need to do next.</p>
