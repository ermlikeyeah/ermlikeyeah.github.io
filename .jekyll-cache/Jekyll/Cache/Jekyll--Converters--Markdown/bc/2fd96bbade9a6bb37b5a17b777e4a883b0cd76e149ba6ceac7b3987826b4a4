<p>Since 2015 I have worked as a freelancer. I have mainly contracted on public sector projects, as an interaction and service designer at <a href="//dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/">DWP Digital</a> and <a href="//hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk">HMRC Digital</a>, and helped with leading design at <a href="//digital.nhs.uk">NHS Digital</a> on the NHS Beta programme.</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2015 I held head of, director, and board positions at the agencies <a href="//www.homeagency.co.uk">Home</a>, <a href="//www.bloomagency.co.uk">Bloom</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)">Brahm</a>, responsible for the digital, design, and creative parts of those companies.</p>

<p>I got my first full time job in 1998, starting as a junior web developer on <a href="//www.sportinglife.com/">Sporting Life</a>. I got to play with databases full of sport data and work out how to put all that onto the internet as information. It was the best first job I could have wished for.</p>
