I"Í<p>Iâ€™ve been looking through some older work recently. Some of it purposely. Some of it accidentally.</p>

<p>Purposely: Iâ€™ve been looking over stuff Iâ€™ve been involved with over the years. Sometimes itâ€™s good to reminisce.</p>

<p>Accidentally: I was reminded this week of a little hack I pulled together last summer, a little hack that tells me if I should hang my washing it out.</p>

<p>I got an email earlier this week from someone who uses the hack/app/service. Iâ€™d forgotten Iâ€™d rattled the app into existence until that email.</p>

<p>The email said the â€œappâ€ wasnâ€™t working quite right. I was surprised that someone was actually using it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d made it as a throwaway thing, one part user centred solution, two parts a test to see if I could come up with something to solve a problem: We were having a week of wet/dry/wet/dry etc weather and wanted to know if I could get the washing out that day. I wanted to solve it  as quickly as possible. Iâ€™d cobble it together in whatever form in a couple of hours downtime, nothing more.</p>

<p>(<a href="/weathering-a-two-hour-hack">I blogged about the thinking and making of this app back then.</a>)</p>

<p>Back to the present: The emailer said they used it regularly, and it was on their phoneâ€™s screen so they could â€œget to it quickâ€. (I didnâ€™t think people saved internet bookmarks to their phoneâ€™s home screen but hereâ€™s someone who does). The weather in the app they said, well, wasnâ€™t the weather outside.</p>

<p>First, I left a little bad. The app should have shown errant weather a bit more than they were suggesting, because Iâ€™d left the evaluation logic a littleâ€¦ loose. (Iâ€™d done it in a strict two hoursâ€¦) Second, I was thankful they seemed to be living locally to me as the app is hardwired only to look up the weather in Bradford.</p>

<p>A couple of emails were swapped between us.</p>

<p>I had to thank the person for getting in touch, how did they find out about the service? Someone had shared it on Facebook.</p>

<p>Why did they use it? They replied it just tells them if they should hang their washing out, it simply provides them answers to a real world problem, nothing more. No need to look through weather data, just a yes or a no.</p>

<p>I was enthused that this person just <em>trusted</em> the service Iâ€™d made. Partly driven by a sense of guilt Iâ€™d let something out not finished/buggy and someone relied on it I fixed the problem raised, and got back to them. Here you go, sorry, thanks for using it. Job done.</p>

<p>Not quite.</p>

<p>Last night I logged on and did some more fixes and improvements, including a look-up service so it now works out where you are (based on your internet connection) and uses weather data appropriate to that location. So itâ€™s not just about Bradford any more. Itâ€™s about where your web connection thinks you are.</p>

<p>And I spent half an hour putting in some logic so it constructs and presents a response in English rather than just a Yes/No and some numbers. Why? The person who emailed me said the app was a great idea, but itâ€™d be even better for them if it â€œspoke to themâ€. So this felt a move in the right direction.</p>

<p>I pushed this new version live at 1am this morning.</p>

<p>I was and am chuffed the person thought this app is a great idea. For me ideas arenâ€™t great unless they solve real world problems, problems that matter.</p>

<p>This app, this thing, this idea that I thought was small and throwaway, did something Iâ€™d forgotten until Iâ€™d got these email and then I re-read <a href="/weathering-a-two-hour-hack">my blog post on making it</a>: It solved a problem that mattered to someone. It mattered so much they got in touch with me about it, to make it â€œbetterâ€. Thatâ€™s the best feeling as a designer and a maker.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can find version two of the app over at <a href="http://www.studioofthings.com/washingout">www.studioofthings.com/washingout</a>. I apologise in advance if itâ€™s not quite right. But, you know where to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
