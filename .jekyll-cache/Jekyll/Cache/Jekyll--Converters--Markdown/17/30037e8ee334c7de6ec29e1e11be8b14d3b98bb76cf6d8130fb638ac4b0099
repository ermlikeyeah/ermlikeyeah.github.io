I"ø<p>Last week right along the top of a whiteboard I wrote something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THIS IS A PROGRAMME OF CHANGE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like that. In capital letters. And with added underline for extra emphasis.</p>

<p>Underneath was a summary of <a href="/design-is-the-process-and-when-designing-works">my colleaguesâ€™ work</a>, their thinking, a rough road map to get us from A to whatever Z we understood at that moment.</p>

<p>There were five points to work through sequentially. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. It was a road map.</p>

<p>They werenâ€™t going to do all the work now in one big go. My colleagues have done the hard work to discover a way to <em>progressively</em> examine, make, and alter the way users, customers, citizens, <em>people</em> interact with government on a particular thing, to make it <em>easier</em>, to make it more a thing of the modern world.</p>

<p>They arenâ€™t going to do all the work now in one big go, disappear, and then reappear, say, a year from now. Their first point will be a start, with something small(ish), that is contained, releasable â€“ and then they will build around and on top of that. Itâ€™s a buzzy of buzzword: Iteration.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s their plan for now. That could change. Theyâ€™ll see how it goes as they go along. Things might change. Insight. Policy. Society even. And again, buzzy buzzword time: Agile.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why I thought it was worth making it clear this is <em>a programme</em>. The danger with putting down these five markers is it is viewed as a <em>project</em>, weâ€™ve set these points down and we rigidly stick to them. Itâ€™s just a road map to help us move forward in the right direction.</p>

<p><em>Projects</em> are things where we put all the work in behind closed doors and get it out. And then weâ€™ll move onto the next thing. Thatâ€™s the â€œold wayâ€ of doing things. Thatâ€™s the waterfall way. Thatâ€™s the big IT firm way. Thatâ€™s just another way.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not the way weâ€™re supposed to do things in government. We have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">a standard</a>, a mandate even. That way of working is why many of us are here in government.</p>

<p>Why do I mention this? It can be all too easy to fall into the â€œold waysâ€, to scope a Thing out, to rigidly make that Thing, and then <em>launch</em> the whole thing, like a massive oil tanker or ocean liner or some other huge ocean-faring vehicle. Done. Gone. Next thing.</p>

<p>No. Not this.</p>

<p>When you work on something that can have a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives we need to make sure we keep a focus on <em>getting something out there</em>. And we need to make sure we can do it sooner rather than later. The â€œnew waysâ€ allow us to drip, drip, drip something out if we want to. Piece by piece we launch, until we have a mass of small things out there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sarahjrichards.com/blog/done-is-better-than-perfect">Sarah Richards wrote recently</a> â€œDone is better than perfectâ€. Sarahâ€™s piece was about content, but it resonates a lot further with me. <em>Done is better than perfect</em> is also a great focus for the Thing You Are Making.</p>

<p>I wrote before on <a href="/weird-science">being more start-up</a>. I made a big edit to that piece just before I published it, looking back I wish Iâ€™d kept in. I originally noted we should treat our digital services more like start-ups. Theyâ€™ve a runway with the clock ticking, their existence in the real world matters, get something solid, something done out â€“ and keep working on it. Because making something and getting it out there in, say, just eight weeks isnâ€™t the end. Itâ€™s just the start. Always be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/beta.html">in beta</a>. Always be releasing better.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t an excuse to to stick any old crap out. Which could be easy, because who else provides the services government compels you to use? Thereâ€™s not competition there but that isnâ€™t an excuse either. Society expects a government to provide.</p>

<p>We talk about how we work to make things simpler, clearer, faster. That shouldnâ€™t just be the output of our work â€“ it should be the way we work to get there. Thatâ€™s what programmes need.</p>
