I"v<p>Met <a href="https://twitter.com/tjharrop">Tom Harrop</a> for a trip to the <a href="http://cooperhewitt.org">Cooper Hewitt</a>, an excellent museum of contemporary design.</p>

<p>Despite  having fun looking for <a href="https://twitter.com/tjharrop/status/716295360470257665">UX/UI memes</a>, the museum is excellent. The screens and pens provided some excellent engaging interactions.

Monument Valley – or stills from it – were on display. Great to see video games represented. Tom hasn’t played it. (<a href="http://blog.monumentvalleygame.com/blog/2015/1/15/monument-valley-in-numbers">Remember the numbers?</a>)</p>

The Models &amp; Prototypes room. Excellent, this. “Test concepts and resolve problems.” I am sort of <a href="/some-short-slides-on-prototypes">into this protoyping game</a> anyway, so this was an easy win for the museum.</p>
