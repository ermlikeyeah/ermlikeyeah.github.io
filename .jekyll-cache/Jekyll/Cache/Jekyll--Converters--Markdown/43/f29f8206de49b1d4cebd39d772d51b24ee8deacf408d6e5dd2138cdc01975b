I"¢<p>The road we live on is a loop road. You go into the loop at the bottom off a feeder road, go up the loop one way, and keep going until you find yourself back where you started. If you want you can go the other way round. Whichever direction, keep going round, and you will be back where you began. Along the road on both sides are houses, meaning there is an ‚Äùisland‚Äù in the middle of the loop with houses.</p>
