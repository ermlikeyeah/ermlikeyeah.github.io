I"><p>I was at the <a href="http://moma.org">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA) in New York a couple of months back. There was (and still is until the end of September 2017) an excellent Frank Lloyd Wright exhibition on.</p>

<p>Wright was a designer who embraced so much. I highly recommend you read up further on him, even if you know of his work already.</p>

<p>in 1935 Wright unveiled a proposal for a community called Broadacre City. To get the idea across Wright made a 12 foot by 12 foot model. Wright was driven by the idea of providing a better life within the American systems of democracy and capitalism.</p>

<p>Here’s a shot of Wright and his apprentices working on the model (taken during my visit to MoMA). If you look closely you can see the model is made up of a four by four grid. Wright was very specific about what went into the model – and what didn’t.</p>

<p>The museum had recreated the model (which I didn’t get a shot of). Next to the model was an activity sheet. The bottom half of the activity sheet carried some of Wright’s rules – exclusions even – for Broadacre.</p>

<p>The exercise the museum set is a good one as well.</p>

<p><em>I believe we need to create a new city because…</em></p>

<p>If you could start from nothing, if you could create your own city what you would you <em>encourage</em>? What would you <em>discourage</em>? What would you <em>exclude</em>, or <em>not let in</em> to your city? Do you know of a city that already exists that meets your vision? Is there a city that already exists that is an antithesis to your ideals?</p>
