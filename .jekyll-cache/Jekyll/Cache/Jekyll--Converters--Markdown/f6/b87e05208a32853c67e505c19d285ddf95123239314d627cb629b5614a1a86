I"÷<p>So, after a little beavering away in the background the Leeds digital lunches are coming back.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the digital lunches are a lunchtime forum where a (digitally focused) topic is talked about by gals and guys with experience on the subject, and other people can mosey along and listen. Itâ€™s informal, itâ€™s relaxed, and in the name of sharing.</p>

<p>The first lunch back is on Friday 11 July at the <a href="http://theodi.org/nodes/leeds">ODI node in Leeds</a>, dovetailing with the nodeâ€™s Friday lectures programme.</p>

<p>The event will unashamedly be a taster on <em>data, open data, and big data</em>, giving you some grounding in the ideas around this - and a glimpse into why Leeds is such a fascinating place to be if youâ€™re a datahead. And if youâ€™re further interested weâ€™ll also try to point you in the direction of other data things going on in the city.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be keeping the event tight so you can get to <a href="http://www.munro-house.co.uk/">Munro House</a>, get the lift to the top floor for 12.45pm, take in half an hour of talk and a little Q&amp;A, and then you can head off at 1.20pm toâ€¦ whatever youâ€™re doing that Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be providing soft drinks and cake - but do feel free to bring your own food, whether itâ€™s a home-made packed lunch or something from the likes of <a href="http://cafe164.com/">Cafe 164</a> or Greggs.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://attending.io/events/odi-leeds-lectures-amp-leeds-digital-lunch">say you want to come at attending.io</a>, which weâ€™ve chosen because itâ€™s simple and easy. The event is free, as weâ€™ve tried to keep most of the digital lunch events.</p>

<p>That cool? â€˜hope so. If youâ€™ve any questions <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Future lunches</strong><br />
Weâ€™re going to make sure thereâ€™s a digital lunch every second week of the month.</p>

<p>Unless anything pops up there will be a break in August due to summer holidays, before returning in September for the second part of the <em>Leeds digital sport story</em>. And thereâ€™s <a href="https://trello.com/b/0fHAMVjs/leeds-digital-lunches">ideas for the months after that</a>.</p>

<p>And we want you to be involved, so the â€˜weâ€™ becomes â€˜youâ€™! Weâ€™re adopting an open approach to programming the lunches.</p>

<p>We want you to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have an idea for a theme/topic youâ€™d like to be considered</li>
  <li>If youâ€™d like to be considered for a talk</li>
  <li>If you know a venue thatâ€™ll take us - or thereâ€™s a venue youâ€™d like us try</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever it is, feel free to shout up!</p>

<p>In the spirit of openness you can view how the lunches are shaping up at <a href="https://trello.com/b/0fHAMVjs/leeds-digital-lunches">an open viewable Trello board</a>, which will be updated regularly.</p>

<p>I am taking a few steps back from the lunches so I wonâ€™t be so much â€œat the frontâ€, just there to coerce people together to talk, and I hope thatâ€™ll the lunches will roll of their own accord at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a way to go before that happens, but in the meantime come to the events - and <a href="/contact">do drop a line this way</a> so we can create events together!</p>
