I"<p>When I was a lot younger, back in the early to late â€˜80s, I used to travel abroad a lot with my mum, dad, and sisters. My dad worked abroad, we went to live wherever he was. In about 1986 my mum got me a little book that had an graphical index of aircraft livery. It was my favourite reference book. It was just right to carry about comfortably <em>everywhere</em>. I used to love seeing those pages with the airline tails in a grid, either for a quick dip into or going over again and again on a car journey.</p>
