I"Û<p>The doctor prints the prescription.</p>

<p>â€œThereâ€™s two options on this prescription. Both are OK but Iâ€™d prefer you have the second option â€“ but the system wonâ€™t let me print just that second option. If you explain to the pharmacist theyâ€™ll be OK.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>The prescription is handed in to the pharmacist. It is explained what the doctor has requested.</p>

<p>A long waiting moment passes.</p>

<p>â€œThe prescribing doctor says you need to get your doctor to write onto this prescription which they prefer, otherwise weâ€™ll give you the first option. Youâ€™ll have to go back to the doctor.â€</p>

<p>Two months ago the same pharmacy was OK with the doctorâ€™s message being passed on. Now the same pharmacy is not so cool with the message being relayed by voice.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the reception for the GPâ€™s surgery the situation is explained.</p>

<p>â€œThis is happening a lot more. Leave your prescription and come back tomorrow morning. The doctor will have written their instructions down.â€</p>

<p>That will be another hour out of the day tomorrow, to travel: There, wait for the prescription to be fulfilled at the pharmacy, and back.</p>

<p>Just accept the first option and put up with the side effects from switching medication? Decisions.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is a piece of paper being passed around. A piece of paper which carries a flawed narrative because the system wouldnâ€™t, couldnâ€™t express what the author intended.</p>

<hr />

<p>You know when the system determines your experience? When you are the connector of the network making up for the systemâ€™s lack of â€œhandshakingâ€ between its parts?</p>

<p>When the system dictates your experience of the service, eh.</p>

<p>This is 2019.</p>
