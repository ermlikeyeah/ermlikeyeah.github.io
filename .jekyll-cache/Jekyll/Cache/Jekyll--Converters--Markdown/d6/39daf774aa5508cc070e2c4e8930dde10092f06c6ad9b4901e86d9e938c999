I"Î<p>Last week, I was having a chat with someone. (Hello, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/techforevil">Zuz</a>.) We were talking about agile/Agile and service design/Service Design. More on that bit another time.</p>

<p>The chat ended up circling â€“ yes, like vultures in the desert, I guess â€“ around some case studies in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Service-Design-Thinking-Basics/dp/906369279X">This is Service Design Thinking</a>. The chat reminded me of a nagging feeling when I read the case studies the first time a few years back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why in these cases did they choose service design as their approach? What motivated them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s a common theme of missing for me, the why.</p>

<p>Take that trusty stead of design, personas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a dot-dot-dot, I want to dot-dot-dot, so I can dot-dot-dot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My issue with personas is usually they skip this <em>why</em> as well.</p>

<p>Personas donâ€™t tell enough of a <em>detailed story</em>, leave gaps, and allows the readerâ€™s brain to fill in the gaps. Brians are very, very good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling-in">at that</a>. This means imagination comes into play, even assumptions, and devalues any empathy.</p>

<p>Where are the desires, the wants, the needs in these?</p>

<p>While we collect and build personas, while we research needs, rarely do we put the two together.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t a declaration that personas are hackneyed. Theyâ€™re a good base. Build on them.</p>

<p>Move them on, from <em>as a something</em> to provide context, put yourself in the situation, in the personâ€™s shoes, explore the <em>when I am here</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When dot-dot-dot, I want to dot-dot-dot, so I can dot-dot-dot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to check briefs before they went into the creative team at Brahm â€“ and constantly asked <em>Why?</em>. Apparently this was annoying. I wasnâ€™t being an awkward arse, honestly. I wanted to understand <em>why</em> we were doing what we were doing, <em>why</em> being not <em>goals</em>, but <em>motivations</em>.</p>

<p>â€œSales are down, they need a boost.â€</p>

<p>â€œMarket research shows people are actually looking for this product.â€</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve tested these ads and weâ€™ve got a direction on what works strongest.â€</p>

<p>â€œThe client just wants us to do it.â€</p>

<p>â€œIf we do this I will look good for my boss and get a much-needed pay rise.â€</p>

<p>There is always a reason, there are always motivations. Recognise motivations. You can then work to solve the actual problems, the actual needs. And thatâ€™s not asking the impossible.</p>

<p>Footnote: I touched upon this in 2014 when <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/idlesi/you-say-persona-i-say-person-ah">I publicly gave a talk at Forefront</a>, mentioning the idea of <em>characters</em>. I also did a <a href="/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser">blog post when I gave the talk</a>.</p>
