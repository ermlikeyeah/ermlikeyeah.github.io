I"<p>It’s week 5 on NHS Jobs, working with <a href="https://difrent.co.uk">Difrent</a> and <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk">NHS BSA</a> as a service designer. I have already had four weeks helping and just come off a couple of weeks away. I can highly recommend this tonic: Spend some time absorbing and getting to know stuff, have a break, come back after a bit of away time and brain soaking time, and get working through problems. I also thought it’d be a good time to get back into getting some week notes out in the open.</p>
