I"S<p>My daughter got a letter through late last month about going on work experience. She is in her penultimate year at secondary school. Work experience is a bit of a ritual in British schools, the chance for people in their mid-teens to get a week or two’s experience in a workplace.</p>

<p>On the reverse side of letter was a form to fill in.</p>

<p>Here is the front and the back.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/18-4-22-1.jpg" alt="The letter and the form" /></p>

<p>Three things stood out for me.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/18-4-22-2.jpg" alt="The letter and the form with the three things highlighted - do not worry, I am going to spell them out shortly" /></p>

<p>One of those was in the letter from the school, two on the form provided by our local council.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/18-4-22-3.png" alt="The three things on their own - they are coming next" /></p>

<p>The first, from the school:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For these reasons students will only go on work experience if they find a company to take them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second, on the form provided by the local council, this bit to be filled in by someone on behalf of the organisation or business offering the work placement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will this company take future students in addition to the one below? Y / N</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third, on the form provided by the local council, this bit to be filled in by someone at the school the child attends:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand there will be a charge of £35 to the school for companies unwilling to go on the database and offer future placements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the school having to pay £35, if the organisation/business offering a placement this year feels it is unable to offer a future place, after a 14 or 15-year-old has found that placement. That is the school having to pay £35 so some other organisation or business does not go on a database. Nothing to opt in. £35 to opt out.</p>

<p>Add in the crowd-sourcing of this database through young people’s efforts to find their own work experience placement?</p>

<p>This is really bad design.</p>
