I"‘<p>I am at Leeds GovJam, helping run things.</p>

<p>There are many great things about doing this. One of them is the most excellent company I get to keep helping out. Itâ€™s fun to talk design with those guys and gals. I donâ€™t get much of that these days.</p>

<p>At lunch <a href="//twitter.com/IamKathrynGrace">Kathryn</a> and I were talking shop. We got onto personas. We both agreed that personas are a starting point. Once you get testing your ideas with people personas should drift off into the sunset.</p>

<p>â€œPersonas are a functional tool to get you from A to B,â€ said Kathryn.</p>

<p>â€œNot A to Z,â€ I replied.</p>

<p>Kathrynâ€™s face lit up. â€œOoooo. I like that.â€</p>

<p>10 minutes later Illustrator was exporting the posterised version of that accidental slogan. Kathryn and I had â€œan officeâ€ as well. Yâ€™know. Like <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_and_Ray_Eames">Charles and Ray</a>. It was a quick bit of fun. I am more writing this post for posterity.</p>
