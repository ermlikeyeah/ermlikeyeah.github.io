I"¾<p>At the end of every week <a href="//twitter.com/jukesie">Matt Jukes</a> publishes notes on his working week. (<a href="//productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-s3e08-7974c08a2b20#.u16dwx78y">Hereâ€™s this weekâ€™s.</a>) For the past few years Iâ€™ve written similar notes into Evernote as a â€œprivate blogâ€, but not publicly published them. I am going to try and publish what I can of those. This is nothing to do with turning 41 last week.</p>
