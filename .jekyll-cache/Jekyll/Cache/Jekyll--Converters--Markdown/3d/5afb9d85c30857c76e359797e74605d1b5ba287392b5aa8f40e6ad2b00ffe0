<h3 id="goals-for-june-2019">Goal(s) for June 2019</h3>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ Run at least 150 kilometres: Ran 141 kilometres, on 19 days out of 31, as had a knee niggle for the last week or so. So close though. Up to 742 kilometres ran this year, 68% of the way from the 1092 kilometres goal for 2019.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ Run four 5 kilometre runs with an average pace of under 5:15 per kilometre: Managed three.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ Run four 10 kilometre runs with an average pace of under 5:45 per kilometre: Managed one.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ Run one half marathon distance: Ran two.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ A speed session every week: Managed this every week but the last (because knee irk, see previously).</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ A stretch session every week: Managed this. Felt better for it as well.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ Weight below 13 stone: Not quite.</p>

<h3 id="the-words">The words</h3>

<p>Bit of an up and down month, ending the month with a dot week due to a knee niggle.</p>

<p>Started strongly with 66 kilometres in the first 10 days setting up a strong month. I also started to go along roads a bit more, rather than just field and canaling it.
63 kilometres in the second third of the month, and weâ€™re rolling. Had <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2447479985">a spritely post-work 5km on the 13th</a>.</p>

<p>That last third though: Wiped out. Ah well. At least my last run of the month was my first go at running on a fell. For fathersâ€™ day the kids â€œboughtâ€ us a Saturday night in a bread and breakfast in the Lakes, so I took advantage on Sunday morning to <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2472803443">run up towards Muncaster Fell</a>. Hard going, but fun.</p>

<p>Did some scouting for different routes though, including having a walk round Baildon Moor looking at how all the paths criss-cross. Looks fun to just run round there.</p>

<p>A shame I was sidelined as I got some short Columbia running shorts. Man, I so wanted to show my legs off to the world. I bet the world wanted to see that too. Sorry, world.</p>

<p>I finished reading Scott Jurekâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eat-Run-Unlikely-Ultramarathon-Greatness/dp/1408833409/">Eat and Run</a> â€“ and ended quoting him at the start of Juneâ€™s Leeds gov design meet. â€œRunning is just graceful fallingâ€ which is a bit like designing, I suggested with all the tenuity in the world. Good book though. Afterwards I enjoyed reading up on the internet about his mate Rusty.</p>

<p>Finally, I bought a couple of running vests to give my running T-shirts a break. Sorry in advance if you follow my running adventures on Strava or Instagram.</p>

<h3 id="next-months-goals">Next monthâ€™s goals</h3>

<p>Run 160 kilometres. Working away a bit in July (near Newcastle) so thereâ€™s three challenges here:</p>

<p>First: Keep fitting some running in.</p>

<p>Second: A chance to try some new routes. (Already had <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/693344063">one suggestion</a>, which looks fun.)</p>

<p>Third: Hit that 160 kilometres target. If I do I am over 900 kilometres for the year, and a solid August will have me nip past the target for the year. ğŸ¤ğŸ¼</p>

<p>Not going for too many distance targets in July but looking to do four 10 kilometre runs during the month and try and have an average KM pace of below 5:45 for those runs. ğŸ¤ğŸ¼</p>

<p>Another half marathon distance would be splendid too.</p>

<p>Another month of a good stretch session once a week. (And fit in some hip strengthening.)</p>

<p>See if I can dodge under 13 stone at last. ğŸ¤ğŸ¼</p>

<p>Enjoy it still. (I am!)</p>
