I"<p>We’re going to hold a meet-up in Leeds for people designing government things, whether they are products or services or whatever you want to call them.</p>

<p>When? It will be on Monday 19 February, from 3pm until 5pm.</p>

<p>Where? This will confirmed this week, but it will be in Leeds city centre.</p>

<p>What will we be doing? We’re going to aim for three or four sessions in the time we have together.</p>

<p>Already I’ve got someone interested in doing a session on policy in design. And we’re sorting a session on registers.</p>

<p>There’s space for a couple more sessions. If you fancy doing one drop me an email. And if you are worried or maybe put off about doing a session, don’t be. You’ll be in a room of people who will appreciate what you do and we’ll support you all the way.</p>

<p>You can reserve a place at the get-together <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-cross-government-design-meet-1-tickets-42817318753">on Eventbrite</a>.</p>
