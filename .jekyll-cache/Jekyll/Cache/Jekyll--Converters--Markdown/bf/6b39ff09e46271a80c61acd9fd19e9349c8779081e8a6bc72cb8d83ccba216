I"V<p>A bit of everything week: Attending an assessment as a design assessor (and the associated prep beforehand and write-up afterwards). Helping with job interviews. Setting up a day of user research sessions (which meant doing some design work and then setting up a prototype as a stimulus). Floating in to help a couple of things with some “quick design work”, and filling in because people were away. Saying goodbye to <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesCapiche">James</a>. Some <a href="http://eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-gov-design-meet-7-…">Leeds gov design</a> prep. Lots and lots of stuff and lots and lots of context switching. I had to give <a href="https://newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures</a> and our own interaction design meet a miss. (I am thankful some of the design team shared what was going on at the latter through Slack.)</p>
