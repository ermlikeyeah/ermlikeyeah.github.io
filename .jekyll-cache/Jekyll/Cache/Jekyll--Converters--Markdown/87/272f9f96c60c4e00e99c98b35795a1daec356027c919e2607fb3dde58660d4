I"}<p>No weeknotes last week mainly because, to be honest, I couldn’t be arsed. My personal weeknotes that these are usually culled from were a little bit grumbly about work at the end of that week – and I don’t think we should air our dirty laundry in public. I just wanted a weekend off and away from work, not picking through the irritations. But it has made me think about how we talk about this stuff. This sort of stuff is a bit too rose-tinted-glasses, just the “good stuff”. Rarely do we talk about the more awkward bits, the painful stuff. How do we go about giving a bit more balance in our regular reports? Anyway.</p>
