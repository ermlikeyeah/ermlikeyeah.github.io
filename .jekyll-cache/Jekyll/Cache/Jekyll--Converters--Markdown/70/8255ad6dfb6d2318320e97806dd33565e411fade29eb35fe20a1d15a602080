I"£<p><em>This weeknote doesnâ€™t carry much about the work I am doing. I was finding my weeknotes about work probably worked better as their own standalone blog posts. If I write any work related blog posts I will link out to them from my weeknotes.</em></p>

<p>At the weekend I went to Middlesbrough for the sonâ€™s basketball game. This meant I couldnâ€™t help with Bradford Coder Dojo, but priorities. The riverside area near Middlesbrough College is super interesting â€” and theyâ€™ve a dock tower. (Always the sign of the best places.)</p>

<p>The start of a new month meant <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/run-note-2020-february">a look back on the previous monthâ€™s running</a>.</p>

<p>I published <a href="https://medium.com/@ermlikeyeah/criticism-a-simple-guide-1b98a1e3f8b7">a small guide to criticism</a>. I could have probably added more to it, but it felt brisk enough to get the bare bones down.</p>

<p>After my first visit to the diabetes nurse at my doctorâ€™s surgery I published my <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-1">first blog post about recently being diagnosed with diabetes</a>, share the journey I am on for anyone who reads it. As I tap this itâ€™s Friday, its 4:30pm, and I am supposed to have had a call about my tests results by now, so I am already off the planned happy path.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening I travelled to Edinburgh to be at the Thursday of <a href="https://2020.govservicedesign.net">Service Design in Government</a>. The sessions I went to were at least each good, but I found the time spent with many good friends was what I got the most from. We chatted, we talked about so many things, from <em>I was going to be interviewed by you but it wasnâ€™t you when I turned up!</em> to the nitty gritty of running a business. From the inane and daft and bollocks to some pretty serious and heavy stuff. I needed that. Itâ€™s been quiteâ€¦ lonely the recent few months. I also managed to sneak in <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3155644767/overview">two</a> <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3156890045">runs</a>! The view from the top of Arthurâ€™s Seat was amazing. Well worth the huff and puff to get up there. And <a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz">Sharon</a> snapped <a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz/status/1235724547720126464">a pic of me looking <em>not grumpy</em></a>.</p>

<p>I am still having conversations off the back of <a href="https://medium.com/@ermlikeyeah/maps-6cf37fde8651">a piece I wrote about maps</a>. Iâ€™ve been asked if there is a talk or workshop I could do around it. I see so many other talks, talks by others, I always wonder why would me doing it be that interesting? But sometimes doing a talk helps you get your thinking straight. Youâ€™re going to say it out loud â€” sometimes with slides too â€” is different to writing it out in a blog post.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t read much more of my current book, as Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of reading of articles and other things along with some writing. Iâ€™ll update <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4156043-si-wilson">Goodreads</a> as I go along though.</p>

<p>Some of that writing is a good 3000 words on design stuff, which felt like a bit of a brain dump. Will I ever publish it? I dunno. Did typing it out help me think some stuff through? Sure did.</p>

<p>Anyway. Time for the weekend.</p>
