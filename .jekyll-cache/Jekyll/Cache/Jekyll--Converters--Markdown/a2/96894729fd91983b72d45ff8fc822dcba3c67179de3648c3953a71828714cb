<p>I am running on the path alongside the canal. My steps aren‚Äôt usually the lightest but today they feel heavier than usual. I am not really concentrating on my running, on a sort of autopilot.</p>

<p>My head is fuzzy and full with work thoughts. Coming for a run was supposed to clear them out ‚Äì or at least give me a break from them. I get stuck in a thought loop. I circle a problem a few times. Time to break out of it.</p>

<p>I look up at the path ahead, curving away to the right. I can see someone else about 150m ahead of me also running. Not much to distract my mind. I try to take in the noises around me.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt notice before the warning sound coming from the train line that runs by the canal.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>Roughly two tings for every step I run.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I put some thought into my strides, see if I can feel less heavy legged.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I open up my stride more.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>It feels like there‚Äôs a more of a fluidity to my running.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting‚ÄìA rider on a bike is suddenly going past my right. The rider is shouting something at me. I can‚Äôt hear him.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I slow down. The rider slows down. I cup my ear, trying to ignore the rail track warning. The rider is agitated. He is shouting at me.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMate, you not hear my bell? It means get out of the way.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt hear his bike‚Äôs bell. The sound of the bell must have got lost in the sound of the rail track warning. I just didn‚Äôt hear it.</p>

<p>I am lost of words. I thought I was sticking to one side of the path, leaving enough room for someone, something to pass. I feel like I‚Äôve done something wrong, scolded because I didn‚Äôt hear something.</p>

<p>In the couple of seconds it takes me to work out what has happened, the rider has picked up his pace and is moving away.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>The pace of my run has dropped. My legs feel heavy again. I stop running.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>

<p>I look up and stare. The water on the canal is still. I see the runner ahead seem to move to the edge of the path as the bike and its rider ease past on the main width of the path.</p>

<p>Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting.</p>
