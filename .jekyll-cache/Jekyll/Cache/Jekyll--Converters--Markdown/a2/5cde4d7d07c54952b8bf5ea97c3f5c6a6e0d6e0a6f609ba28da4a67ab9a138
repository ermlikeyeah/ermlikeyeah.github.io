<p>I think one of the biggest killers of perspective is just spending time in your own environment. Looking sideways, looking wider is difficult sometimes though.</p>

<p>Asking yourself key questions is hard with nothing to compare your work to: How are we doing? How does it compare to what other people are doing? Is this that bad really? Is this that good really?</p>

<p>Getting your head out of the water, out of the sand even is refreshing.</p>

<p>I try to get out of the day-to-day patterns every month by taking some time off and getting out, spend some time away from where I currently am.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is just an hour. Others half a day. On the odd occasion a full day. Whether it is a nip in for a natter, spending time seeing how other orgs do stuff (like design crits, workshops), and occasionally kindly being invited to take part in stuff.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve sort of fallen off this wagon in recent months. But Iâ€™ve started up again. This month Iâ€™ve dipped into a couple of places and theyâ€™ve been great sense checks â€“ and also good stretches of my thinking.</p>

<p>I have an appeal of two halves.</p>

<p>First: If you donâ€™t take this time out yourself, try it. Give it a go.</p>

<p>Second: If youâ€™re a place doing interesting stuff â€“ and that could be how you go about it as much as what you are doing â€“Â Iâ€™d love to bob in. <a href="/contact">Drop me a line</a>. I am open to most things.</p>
