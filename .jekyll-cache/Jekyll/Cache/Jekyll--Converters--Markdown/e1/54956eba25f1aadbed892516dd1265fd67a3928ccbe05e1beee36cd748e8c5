I"¸<p>I bumped into a pal on the train last week. She, like me, â€œmade the leapâ€ to work for (a part) government.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/the-right-stuff.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sheâ€™s got a bloody good track record, someone who has been there and worked hard to make some really good stuff. Sheâ€™s smart, know her beans, wants to get stuff done, streetwise, a proper team player. Sheâ€™s the sort of person that the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, BBCs, R/GAs, and all that have had â€” and would love to have. Sheâ€™s the sort of person itâ€™s good to know weâ€™ve got in government. Sheâ€™s the sort of person we need more of in government.</p>

<p>During our train trip we had a catch up, talked about life anâ€™that, and eventually ended up comparing our bits of government.</p>

<p>In short, we got round to some of the obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not all government departments are forks of GDS.</li>
  <li>Not all government departments are the same.</li>
  <li>Not all of a government departmentsâ€™ bases are the same.</li>
  <li>Nor are all of a government departmentsâ€™ services are the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the least these differences give you the chance to compare notes. But I was a little surprised how our chat around this ended.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s a lot harder than I thought. I knew itâ€™d be hard but everything I read and heard didnâ€™t prepare me. Weâ€™re pushing against people who are managers who think a different way, and we should be working with them. Or they should be working with us. Weâ€™re trying to get â€™buy inâ€™ to what is the way of working we signed up for. My choice at the moment: Do I keep pushing, pushing, pushing â€“ or do I just go to a place that does this because itâ€™s part of its DNA? Thereâ€™s a lot of exciting, progressive stuff going on outside of government. There does not seem enough of a will for that in government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, sheâ€™s decided, she is off. â€œIâ€™ve had a go, Iâ€™ve had enough. Thereâ€™s only so much you can keep telling yourself this for the people.â€</p>

<p>And because sheâ€™s the sort of person that the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, R/GA and all that would love to have, sheâ€™s actually off to one of them. And she is not the only person. <em>Another</em> good, talented person leaves government.</p>

<p>Change isnâ€™t easy. Change is hard. But gov feels like it makes it harder than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Last week Mikey Dickerson of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">the U.S. Digital Service</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/south-by-southwest-one-year-later-5fc6e677aead#.j0cd7avg7">blogged</a> to say â€œWe still need you to join usâ€, looking for â€œtalented peopleâ€ to join them. Notably Dickerson is very up front about one thing in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Iâ€™ll be honest: this can be the most frustrating and difficult work youâ€™ll ever do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The past week has reiterated here in the UK we, in government, need to be more open (weâ€™re supposed to work in the open) but also be increasingly honest about where we actually are, where we are going, what weâ€™re doing well, and what weâ€™re struggling with.</p>

<p>Digi gov is very good at celebratory PRing whatâ€™s very good. What place isnâ€™t? We need to cover the other stuff as openly as well. And not just from people who have left the grid, <a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheuser/gov-uk-from-the-inside-e3d0ab3479e6#.y42rc3yfe">like Tom Harrop</a>. People still inside.</p>

<p>Some of the stuff coming out of GDS at the moment is made of this right, balanced stuff. Neil Williams on <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/06/gov-uk-isnt-finished/">gov.ukâ€™s new focus</a>. Stephen Gill and company on <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/27/the-beginnings-of-a-content-strategy-for-gov-uk/">linking content</a>. The wider government family needs to contribute to this.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/21/we-asked-100-of-our-coworkers-why-did-you-join-18f/">great piece over on 18Fâ€™s blog</a>, on <em>Why did you join 18F?</em>, where the first respondent says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wanted a new challenge, and I wanted to learn from some of the best minds in design and technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thereâ€™s a bit in Obamaâ€™s recent SXSW talk that particularly struck me. When Medicare went wrong, the US government got in people from the likes of Google and Facebook to come sort stuff out. The US government got in some of the best minds, the best talent. And gave them pretty much a clear road, a runway to turn it around. A very real business problem, a very real challenge. Take the Silicon Valley ways of getting stuff done and apply them to gov issues, peopleâ€™s issues.</p>

<p>What is the same in the US needs to be the same in the UK. At the moment working for government, designing, making governmentâ€™s service is a place that can attract the best people, the best <em>talent</em> to make things better.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s not squander these opportunities. Let the nerds, the geeks, the talent know what they are coming into and let them just get on with it. Otherwise theyâ€™ll be off to the Googles, Facebooks, Amazons, BBCs, R/GAs and all that.</p>
