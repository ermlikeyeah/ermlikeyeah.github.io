I"<p>Sad times this morning, with <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-dies-of-cancer-aged-55">news of the passing</a> of undoubted games industry legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoru_Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a>.</p>

<p>This comes after a weekend when I finally reached the end of <em>Jack N’ Jill</em> on my Nexus 5. (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rnarang.android.games.jacknjill&amp;hl=en_GB">It’s here on Google Play</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/jack-n-jill/id686985871?mt=8">over here on iTunes</a>.) It’s rare these days to reach the scripted end of a game, especially on a mobile game.</p>

<p>While a lover of computer and console games, I really have a love-hate relationship with mobile games, as well as browser-based games. Very few are mindful of the limitations those environments set, let alone take advantage of the platforms to create something half-decent.</p>

<p>In short: Most mobile phone and browser-based games are rubbish.</p>

<p>Jack N’ Jill is mindful that it is <em>a game on a mobile phone</em>. You control the character with a “tap screen to control” approach rather than trying to emulate a console controller on-screen. The game starts as a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game#Endless_running_games">endless runner</a> where the player taps the screen to make the character - Jack - jump from platform to platform, with the goal of reaching Jill at the end of every level.</p>

<p>Fall off the bottom of the level? Life used up. Hit a bad dude? Life used up. Fall against some spikes? Life used up. Each time you start again, from the start of the level or the most recent mid-level restart point (which are introduced later in the game).</p>

<p>As the game progresses the character can jump onto walls to jump off, bounce off baddies when landing on them, and collect wings to do a bit of Flappy Birding. There’s 140 levels split into groups of 20 where new game mechanisms are introduced. The graphics are very Gameboy, the tunes are alright.</p>

<p>And for the most part it’s quite enjoyable. There’s the odd really frustrating level, but I know it’s me and my timing of input not the game itself. At times the game made me feel like a terrible gamer, my skills weren’t up to it. The game plays very few tricks - there’s the odd really tight squeeze, an occasional pixel perfect jump, and a couple of points I <em>really</em> had to know the level map ahead to progress. But I knew it was me.</p>

<p>Overall it’s taken about six months to get to the end. When I got there, I felt pretty good. I had beaten the game. It felt <em>rewarding</em>.</p>

<p>I was also watching some of the Tour de France at the weekend. Great times in Yorkshire last year as the famous cycle race kicked off in the county.</p>

<p>I was reminded of a browser-based game I played last summer, part of Yorkshire Building Society’s campaign around their sponsoring the Tour de France’s <a href="http://letour.yorkshire.com/">Grand Depart in Yorkshire</a>. The campaign itself was great, some good use of media and some inventive creative. Along with the campaign came a web-based game.</p>

<p>I wrote at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is less a game made <em>to enjoy</em> but <em>to endure</em>. The controls are barely described to the user, and even then seem erratic to respond. There is no commitment that a game should be tied down to learning patterns to progress but the speed obstacles come at you combined with the vague sense of control here makes this more a game of chance than a game of skill.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t decide: Is this a game that is badly designed, is it designed people who actually get why people play games? It is clearly designed to deliberately frustrate. But the more I play it the more I feel it is a game that has been designed by people who actually hate gamers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every time I play the game, every time my rider falls off his bike I just can’t evade the obstacle. I feel helpless, like the game is designed to beat me at some point, the sooner the better. I persisted. There must be <em>something</em> in there. Playing it drove me to rage, my hands turning to clenched fists every time. I gave up after 40 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare to Jack N’ Jill, which was frustrating, but was designed to be something you progressed through, something you felt you had a sense of control over, had a sense of progress?</p>

<p>The YBS TdF game had a really pleasing visual retro-esque aesthetic and looks lively with its bright colours and seemingly simple gameplay (although it does that mixing pixelated and non-pixelated approach I find uneasy), which drew my son to it. He had several goes and made no progress. “That’s not just fun,” was his review. In a nutshell a seven-year-old had nailed it.</p>

<p>As Satoru Iwata said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Above all, video games are meant to be just one thing: fun. Fun for everyone.</p>
