I" <p>Yesterday - Tuesday 3 July - we had the third Leeds cross gov design meet. (Following on from <a href="/leeds-gov-design-1-done/">the first</a> and <a href="/leeds-cross-gov-meet-number-2-done/">the second</a>.)</p>

<p>About 20 people came along, and so so good to see a wide range of roles at a wide range public focused organisations represented. Thank you to all that came along and especially those that did sessions.</p>

<p>We are looking at doing a fourth meet in September.</p>

<p>Things we are looking for for future meets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People to run sessions. Sessions can be a talk, a show and tell, a workshop: anything you want as long as it has a gov or public sector slant.</li>
  <li>Places to host the meets. It would be great to have the meets in places where gov and public sector work happens.</li>
</ul>
