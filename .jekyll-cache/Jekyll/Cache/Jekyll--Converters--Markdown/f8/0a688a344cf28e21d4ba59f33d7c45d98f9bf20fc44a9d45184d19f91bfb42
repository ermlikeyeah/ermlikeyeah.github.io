I"ı<p>I get asked, a lot, â€œto look at this from a user experience point of viewâ€.</p>

<p>Because what else would I do? Look at it from a userâ€™s non-experience? A userâ€™s unexperience? A non-userâ€™s experience. Maybe on that last one. But a <em>user experience</em>?</p>

<p>Isnâ€™t everything we do when we make something contributing to the user experience? Isnâ€™t that the teamâ€™s work, collectively? When someone engages/interacts with whatever we make - website, ad, brochure, video game, cash machine interface, product, service, utility, <em>thing</em> - that is a user experiencing. That is their user experience. We are all, collectively, always designing, always contributing to, and must always be mindful of the user experience. Looking at it from a user experience point of view is the teamâ€™s work.</p>

<p>If someone asks you to â€œLook at this from a user experience point of viewâ€ theyâ€™re approaching it as a function, a role, a task, a part, <em>some thing</em> in the approach to the job.</p>

<p>Make sure they know <em>user experience is the job</em>, user experience is in the delivery, and our strategy is delivering.</p>

<p>And if I was looking at it from a â€˜user experience point of viewâ€™: isnâ€™t that â€œuser researchâ€ anyway?</p>
