I"H<p>I love looking out for signage.</p>

<p>Some signage I love because they delight me in some way. Like <a href="/air-lines/">signage in airports</a> and <a href="/a-sense-of-doing-something/">wheelchair signs in New York</a>. Them are da best signs.</p>

<p>Here is another of my favourites, on an air hockey table at the Hollywood Bowl in Bradford.</p>

<p>Wonderful is it not?</p>

<p>Some signs make me scratch my head, like they are a puzzle, an enigma even.</p>

<p>Here is one of my “fave” head scratchers, close to where I live, turning out of Woodhouse Grove onto Harrogate Road.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/17-04-2018-harrogate-road-sign.jpg" alt="The sign giving instructions how to turn out onto Harrogate Road" /></p>

<p>The punchline is you see this sign as you drive into Woodhouse Grove not as you are driving out as you would actually need it.</p>

<p>If you are curious what the road map this is trying to show looks like, here you go (nabbed from <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.8376677,-1.7036211,17z">Google Maps</a>).</p>

<p>Out of sheer <em>I had both of those images open in Photoshop</em>-ness I comped the map onto the sign.</p>

<p>At least the landmarks make it a little easier to understand.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>
