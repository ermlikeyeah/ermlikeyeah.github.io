I"Å<p>It‚Äôs now two months since I wrote about <a href="/public-design-WY">getting Public Design WY going</a>. The first meet-up is now done. Yay!</p>

<p>My thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneBuchan">Leanne Buchan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery">Lisa Jeffery</a> for stepping up to lead a session each.</p>

<p>Leanne talked with us about designing a city‚Äôs culture strategy. You can find out more about that at <a href="http://leedsculturestrategy.co.uk/">the strategy‚Äôs website</a>.</p>

<p>Lisa‚Äôs session was on why she loved jamming, and gave the attendees the chance to do some jam activities. Lisa has made her slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yV66LDllJYMeiwbJTnyV99S3MRUTuTXC8grUg2nz9Fo/edit?usp=sharing">available for everyone</a>. More information about the upcoming Leeds GovJam and jamming in general is on <a href="https://leedsgovjam.com">the Leeds GovJam website</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who came. If you popped along I‚Äôd love to know what was good, not-so-good, and confusing. Leave feedback on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239151881/">the event‚Äôs Meetup page</a> or <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, also a big thanks to <a href="http://futurelabs.org.uk">Futurelabs in Leeds</a> for the awesome space.</p>

<p>And finally, Public Design WY will return. #2 is going to be on Tuesday 13 June, again at <a href="http://futurelabs.org.uk">Futurelabs in Leeds</a>. All the info and saying you want to come is <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239747499/">over on Meetup</a> again.</p>

<p>And #3 is also planned, for Wednesday 12 July. We‚Äôll be at <a href="http://www.dhez.org">DHEZ / Digital Catapult Centre Yorkshire in Bradford</a>.
