I"€<p>Early this week I told my manager and my fellow designers at HMRCâ€™s digital delivery arm that <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/725374078211727361">I am leaving</a>. I had an offer. It wasnâ€™t the first I have had over the past few months. But this time I wasnâ€™t going to say no. I couldnâ€™t say no. It feels the right time, it feels the right opportunity.</p>
