I"J<p>It’s four in the morning. I’ve woken up in the middle of the night, can’t get back to sleep, so I’ve got the NBA play-offs on. No idea why I can’t get back off. Maybe it’s because later today, during normal daylight hours, we’re due back the verdict from the assessment for the service I work with others on.</p>
