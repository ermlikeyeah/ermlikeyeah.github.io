I"K<p>After expecting a follow-up call from the GP surgery’s diabetes nurse on Friday <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-notes-number-2">I spent the weekend not knowing what is next</a>. I decided to wait until Monday and ring the GP surgery and just explain I’d been expecting a call on Friday, what do I do next?</p>
