I"ª<p>This morning I was walking the dog. The dog is happy walking around on her own, so I decide to do a little life admin. Itâ€™s a busy day ahead, not sure Iâ€™ll get the chance to do it all, Iâ€™ll steal a march now.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got my phone in my hand. I decide to do a bank transfer, to someone I havenâ€™t transferred to before.</p>

<p>I log into my bankâ€™s website through the web browser on my phone (Chrome Beta), which is painless enough, done it before quite a bit, and go to the Payment section from my current account page. I go to the option to send a payment to someone I havenâ€™t sent a payment to before (which is more succinctly presented than that, because thatâ€™s the value of good content design).</p>

<p>I enter the sort code of the account I am sending money to. The screen responds to say which bank that sort code is with. I enter the account number of the account I am sending money to. I click the continue button.</p>

<p>The screen refreshes and I am presented with the following:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/bank_grab_1.jpg" alt="Screen grab" /></p>

<p>On the screen I go to tap the Mobile option and see it is already selected â€“ and then looking down at the next option notice that the Home number isnâ€™t ours. We havenâ€™t got a landline at home any more. But that phone number isnâ€™t our old number. Or any of our numbers in the past.</p>

<p>My default form of telephone contact is through my mobile telephone. My wife is the same. We donâ€™t even have a landline anymore.</p>

<p>I quickly switch tabs in my browser and search for the area code 01744. Itâ€™s St Helens. Weâ€™ve never leaved in St Helens. I am worried.</p>

<p>At this point I actually want to stop what I am doing and sort this out. I look on screen. Nothing asks me â€œIs one of these numbers not yours?â€</p>

<p>I decide to press on, making absolutely sure I have selected the Mobile option before continuing. I complete the transaction, but I am not happy. Something is amiss.</p>

<p>I am sure that nothing has gone from my accounts without me knowing. But I go to the screen of payment recipients my account can send money to. Everything on there is as I expect it. No unknown recipients.</p>

<p>I look at how I can change my Home number through the website. It seems easy enough. But I still have this niggling feeling. How did this happen? Where did this number come from? I hold back from changing the number and get in touch with my bank, <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/766168045589004288">through Twitter</a>. They respond with two numbers I could ring,  and I choose one and call.</p>

<p>The call starts by asking me for my card number, my date of birth and the three digit code off the back of my card. I am promptly put through to someone.</p>

<p>I briefly explain the situation, much like Iâ€™ve tapped out above (and eerily like I am taking someone through some designs at work). I also say how I am actually feeling a little unsure about this. I reiterate I didnâ€™t enter this number.</p>

<p>I am asked if I have made any payments recently. I say yes, I did one about an hour ago, which is when I realised this. I set up a new recipient and made a transfer.</p>

<p>â€œAnd before that?â€ I make transfers regularly, but this is the first time I have set up a new recipient for some time, I think. It is definitely the first time I have noticed the number is wrong â€“Â but then I am a mobile telephone first kinda person.</p>

<p>The person on the other end of the line asks if the Home number has ever been a number I have held. I say reiterate no, and that we have never lived in St Helens.</p>

<p>I ask if I can find out when and maybe how this number was entered into the system.</p>

<p>The chap on the other end of the line says he can look, and after a brief pause he tells me the number has been on my account for over a year â€œbecause I can only search back up to a yearâ€.</p>

<p>I am curious. Maybe the bank tried to call out landline and couldnâ€™t get through, so maybe this is one of the bankâ€™s numbers? Or some sort of number that is a short code for the operators to show the landline isnâ€™t in use?</p>

<p>â€œNo, it isnâ€™t a thing the bank uses. It could be a glitch in the system. We moved some data around and another number got put against your account. Or it was blank and we filled with another random number.â€</p>

<p>Pardon?</p>

<p>â€œMaybe it was blank and we [the bank] put another random number in there.â€</p>

<p>Whose number? I ask.</p>

<p>â€œAnother homeâ€™s number.â€</p>

<p>I ask how can I find out when this number was added, as I am a little concerned. This phone number could have access to my account, somehow.</p>

<p>I am told he cannot, but another department cannot. I ask how I can get in touch with them. He offers up a phone number for me to write down (rather than transferring me). I take down the number. I say thanks. I hang up.</p>

<p>On the short train journey into Leeds I think this through. I have this department who can help, I do not want to change the number because I am worried inserting no number might destroy any chance of finding out more. I feel foolish for not noticing sooner. And how could I have not known this number had been changed? The answers I got about how this could have happened?</p>

<p>In the space of an hour the trust I hold in my bank has gone, not just because of the <em>How Did That Number Get There?</em> and the reasons offered, but because I am the one who has to dial through to this other department to allay my fears. Itâ€™s making me think I <em>really</em> need to switch banks.</p>

<p>Anyway, all the above, the value of good service design through bad service design.</p>
