<p>Earlier this week I passed the poster above. Youâ€™ve probably seen this sort of DIY lost cat/dog/other pet animal posters at some time.</p>

<p>This one was stuck to one of those metal cabinets you sometimes see in streets, that probably houses a technical exchange of some sort. (Something worth breaking your walk to check next time you go past one, maybe.)</p>

<p>This poster caught my eye especially, because it <em>tells a story</em>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s clearly <strong>someone wanting to find their beloved pet</strong>. Thatâ€™s the bit we expect. We know what these posters <em>mean</em>.</p>

<p>But when did you see one that told you the next bit of the story?</p>

<p>A first for me.</p>

<p>â€œPreviously Iâ€™ve been looking for my cat. Now Iâ€™ve got the cat back.â€</p>

<p>And Iâ€™ve not just seen one of these posters. Iâ€™ve seen several. And all with this addendum. Itâ€™s a lovely story.</p>

<p>The poster also adds in another bit of feedback: Yes, the story above concluding with <em>the catâ€™s back home</em>, because <strong>these posters do work</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to all those who looked for him and contacted us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s great to see a happy ending, and also great to see user feedback.</p>

<p>If you ever have to put these posters consider finishing off your story. Especially if it is a happy one.</p>

<p>Because, yes, even I like happy endings.</p>
