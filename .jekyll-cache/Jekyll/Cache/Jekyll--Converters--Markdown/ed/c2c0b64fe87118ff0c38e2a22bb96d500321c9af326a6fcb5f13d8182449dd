<p>A couple of new stickers I have had printed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/design-make-learn-digital-socialism.jpg" alt="Design, Make, Learn and digital socialism stickers" /></p>

<p>The first carries a Design-Make-Learn loop. These were designed a couple of weeks back during my sabbatical.</p>

<p>We had drawn a diagram to explain the lean design loop, and just wrapped the words round a circle. Time in Illustrator: 15 minutes. Someone knew a decent localish printer. Sent artwork at 3pm, picked up early the next day. We did them as a leave-behind, a reminder of smaller, quicker thinking-making-feedback loops which we were doing in a place that didn‚Äôt do that too much. Something something transformation something something. The visual design is not bang on, but done is better than perfect, eh. It was also fun to see which word people chose to put at the top. Design, make, or learn. (Or at least I try to tell myself that their choice means something.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/854610071879331840">posted a pic of the sticker on Twitter</a> after we got them. People wanted some. So I have done a run of them.</p>

<p>The second: I recently read Kevin Kelley‚Äôs <a href="http://amzn.to/2qdKKoB">The Inevitable</a>. If you don‚Äôt know who Kelley is, he was one of the founders of <a href="http://wired.com">Wired</a>. The Inevitable is a great book.</p>

<p>In one of the chapter‚Äôs Kelley brings up Clay Shirky‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúdigital socialism‚Äù, the hierarchy of sharing, cooperation, collaboration, collectivism. The theory is cribbed from Shirky‚Äôs <a href="http://amzn.to/2prYriC">Here Comes Everybody</a>. (Sideline: Shirky‚Äôs <a href="http://amzn.to/2ps3zDB">Little Rice</a> is one of the best shorter reads I have taken in over recent years.)</p>

<p>On first read of this chapter in Kelley‚Äôs book I thought I was re-reading the chapter. Did I read this last night when I was really tired and forgot? But then I remembered I‚Äôd read Kelley‚Äôs original piece on Shirky‚Äôs thoughts in Wired years ago. You can <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/the-new-socialism">read Kelley‚Äôs piece online here</a>. I realised that because I searched my Evernote notes. Cribbed notes on this ‚Äì and a loose idea for a poster I‚Äôd forgotten. I‚Äôve just lifted the design, squared it out a bit, and got it printed onto a clear background.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
