I"_<p>Monday was some wider design team actions (sorting out designers to get some experience on assessments, sorting designers for some upcoming assessments, little catch-ups with a couple of senior designers), a user research session go-through, and off the back of that getting down some screens to help talk through and then explore a tricky problem with the business analysts in the team. Showing your thinking, talking it through, being clear what the issues are, and doing what is needed to narrow down your thoughts is best with a conversation of open minded people focused on the problem in hand.</p>
