I"•<p>Advertising may be coming to your thermostat and lots of other strange places, courtesy of Google <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/21/google-predicts-ads-in-odd-spots-like-thermostats/">ran a recent piece in the WSJ</a>.</p>

<p>The jist was Google had documented they could put ads on â€œrefrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, and watches, to name just a few possibilities.â€ Which isnâ€™t that relevatory. Google could put ads there, through one/some/all of those suggested, um, devices, and maybe some others that havenâ€™t been created/lanched to the public. Itâ€™s just a sweeping statement of possibility.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite no direct reference to Google pushing this through Nest devices, the WSJ article inferred this could be an eventuality - and provided a few people with an easy swipe at the now Google owned Nest. The idea of ads through a homeâ€™s thermosystem interfaces doesnâ€™t sit easy with some.</p>

<p>(The idea of Nest actually serving ads doesnâ€™t sit easily in my mind either, but more from the challenge of how the ads would display on a Nest device in the first, and without compromising the visibility of data.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I sometimes switch the radio on in the kitchen and it is tuned into the station <a href="http://www.heart.co.uk/">Heart</a>. Between some of the songs and chit-chat thereâ€™s ads. I also have a radio in my car, which sits in the carâ€™s dashboard. (Part of me wonders when ads became a mainstay of radio airing, but thatâ€™s tangential.)</p>

<p>While Nest is all Internet of Thingy and â€˜forward thinkingâ€™, would Google look the other way, to a â€˜retroâ€™ system/technology like a car radio as a way into cars - or maybe even a way to extend out from â€˜web mediaâ€™? Google through my radio? That seems an odd space to me - but an existing, prevailant one. And Google did mention â€˜car dashboardsâ€™ according to the WSJ. Just a thought.</p>
