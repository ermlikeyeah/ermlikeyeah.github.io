I"ã<p>Unbelievable.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<p>Some of the words used to describe how Casey Neistat decided to spend the $25,000 marketing budget for <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em> on aid for victims of typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in early November.</p>

<p>Neistat made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU7rhVub0rU">a neat little film</a> of his efforts which popped up on the internet a month back. The video was insanely popular.</p>

<p>Casey Neistat is an intriguing filmmaker, probably most famously known outside of the States for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzE-IMaegzQ">his video on biking in New York</a> and has form with creatively using marketing budgets (as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg">this video for Nike shows</a>).</p>

<p>Neistat deserves a lot of credit for his Haiyan effort, really.</p>

<p>A thought though: Whoever at Fox decided to get in touch with Neistat (as is stated in the video), asking for his pitch, must have known that something like this would be floated.</p>

<p>If anyone is unbelievable, cool, and/or awesome itâ€™s that person at Fox who decided to contact Neistat in the first place. Well done that person. Proper creative thinking that.</p>

<p>Also: Instead of pissing marketing money down the drain more of this sort of thing, please.</p>

<p><em>Footnote: I am pretty sure the marketing budget for the film was way in advance of $25,000 - but letâ€™s not split hairs.</em></p>
