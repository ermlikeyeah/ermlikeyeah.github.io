I"G<p>I had a quick half hour at the weekend to pull together a quick thing that sits between two big databases. Normally I’d call this a “hack”, but some of you might think that suggests something illegal. No laws were broken in the making of this thing! If we have to jargonise it let’s call it a “data linker”.</p>
