I"<p>It was a privilege to be asked to speak at <a href="forefront.cc/forefront-no9-november-25th-at-the-belgrave/">Forefront Leeds</a> last night – almost a year on from when <a href="http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/">I last talked at the event</a>.</p>

<p>It’s never a problem to support the work <a href="https://twitter.com/russpoulter">Russ Poulter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chriskemm">Chris Kemm</a> put into pulling the event together by saying yes to their invites, putting the time in to write a talk, and then deliver it on the night – especially alongside two other engrossing talks from <a href="https://twitter.com/webbist">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/becskr">Becs</a>. I loved the breadth of topics and touchpoints, especially Alex showing off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a> and Becs reminding me of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah/status/669049621231091715">overly happy emails I get from Virgin Trains</a>.</p>

<p>There’s always an open-minded and engaged crowd at Forefront, which makes talks a little more leftfield-than-usual easier to give. So, equally good work from those that came along, and enjoyed/endured my talk.</p>

<p>Also great to have the chance to leg it back and talk in Leeds, where I spent many years working. Hopefully I gave something back to the city, hopefully a little more than cheap laughs.</p>

<p>Forefront is one of a number of brilliant design and tech events in the area that have appeared over the past five or so years. The city has a strong, more open, more visible scene these days. Long may that continue.</p>

<p>Thank you all.</p>
