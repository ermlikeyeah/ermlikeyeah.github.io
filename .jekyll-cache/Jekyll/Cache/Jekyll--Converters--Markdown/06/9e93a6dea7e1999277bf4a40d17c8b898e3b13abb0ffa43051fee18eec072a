I"ª<p>I was looking around the edges of this blog last weekend, briefly, and remembered I had <a href="/side-projects">a page for side projects</a>. It was more something I pulled together a couple of years ago when I was doing a few small hacks and wanted to have a simple front door to them. (Thereâ€™s plenty of other side projects that werenâ€™t listed on there, like <a href="///www.codalmighty.com/">Cod Almighty</a>.)</p>
