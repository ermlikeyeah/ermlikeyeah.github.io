<p>Working on creating HMRCâ€™s digital services thereâ€™s great benefits using GDSâ€™s work as a platform (<a href="/gds-as-a-platform">blogged about previously here</a>). Itâ€™s informed. Itâ€™s easy to access to crib from. It helps us get up and running. It helps us get on with the work.</p>

<p>The pay-off: Thereâ€™s also limits in what we do at work. Do not misread this: The work I do is fun, a certain kind of fun.</p>

<p>Everyone likes to cut loose once in a while, especially when youâ€™re working off a design platform on digitalising government services.</p>

<h4 id="2">2</h4>
<p>Today some of the HMRC Digital team left work after their dayâ€™s work, and headed off for a little design session.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/stickers-workshop.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>GDS have their own stickers (have a look at Ben Terrettâ€™s <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/benterrett/11209009683">first Mac at GDS</a>). We thought itâ€™d be fun, even cool to have a go at thinking about, designing some stickers from the work we do. It was also a great chance to think about design outside the platforms and services we focus on daily.</p>

<p>In an hour, we talked, scribbled, explored ideas around where we work.</p>

<p>HMRC is a rich hive for â€œtopicsâ€ associated with it.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s the language of finance. It can be technical. It can be daunting. But what about more popular references to that?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/super-mario-bros.jpg" alt="Super Mario Bros" /></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s the form numbers â€“ which is a government love â€“ and what they mean. Some of them tie into life events, such as leaving a job, with the infamous P45 most widely known.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s the way we work: agile, by listening. Could we celebrate, say, a novice building their first prototype in-browser?</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s the challenges creating digital services, the benefits of what digital services can bring, the improvements that can happen, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/hmrc-fails-to-answer-thousands-of-tax-credit-calls">constantly in the public eye</a>.</p>

<p>We delved into looking at the more public faces of HMRC in the past - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_the_Tax_Inspector">Hector the Inspector</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQewKiBQlU">Moira Stewart</a>.</p>

<p>We also had a look into the places leading the creation of HMRCâ€™s digital services: Newcastle, London, Telford, and Shipley. What makes them stand out. A sample of Newcastle: the bridges, Jimmy Nail, Viz, the football team, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grey,_2nd_Earl_Grey">Charles Grey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cowen">Joseph Cowen</a>.</p>

<p>(Note: We really need a great bridge in Shipley to help us do a series of bridge based stickers for each location. Not quite sure the one on Otley Road over the canal will do the job.)</p>

<p>In an hour we got through so much, pulled together some rough ideas, sketching ideas on paper and in Keynote. We decided weâ€™d get three or four ideas into three pots: â€œlocalesâ€; â€œrecognition (of success) / motivationâ€; and â€œslogans/straplinesâ€. And we thought through what would be appropriate, in tone of the stickers themselves and how you could get a sticker (which could we just give away? which would need to be â€œearnedâ€?).</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be taking our ideas back to the wider HMRC Digital team â€“ not just the design team â€“ and get their input, what they like/dislike, and see if there any other needs. Working with our wider colleagues is a big part of what we do, cooperation is key.</p>

<h4 id="3">3</h4>
<p>The biggest takeaway: Itâ€™s easy to have your head down at work. Just getting away from work, to talk about our work with a specific productive goal, in a more open manner is something we should all do more.</p>

<p>Whether you think stickers are cool or daft, it gave us that focus to talk, to create with purpose.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t just a case of getting out once in a while to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzvz1j3h4Xk">look around you</a> â€“ but to get out once in a while, to get out of the bubble, and <em>do something</em>.</p>

<p>And we had fun doing it.</p>

<p><em>ps. In case youâ€™re here looking for an example of taxpayers money being wasted, weâ€™ll be continuing this work in our own time and paying for the stickers ourselves.</em></p>
