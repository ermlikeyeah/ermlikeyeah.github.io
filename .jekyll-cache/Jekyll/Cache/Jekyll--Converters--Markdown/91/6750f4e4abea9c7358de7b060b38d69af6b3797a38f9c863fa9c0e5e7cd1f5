I"Š<p><a href="/mentor-offer">Back in April</a> I asked if anyone fancied some mentoring, specifically from me.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didnâ€™t follow through. A combo of tying stuff up at HMRC and prepping to join the nhs.uk team got in the way of me replying. And since then itâ€™s been full on.</p>

<p>Sorry if you got in touch. I hold my hands up. My bad.</p>

<p>Anyway, the offer still stands. The past six months is the first time in about 10 years Iâ€™ve not really been mentoring someone. And itâ€™s something I miss. I like to give something back. If my skills, knowledge, and/or experience could help you as a person or your career, Iâ€™d be up for that!</p>

<p>So if you fancy it â€“ and â€˜itâ€™ would be hooking up every six weeks or so for about a year â€“ <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a> with a little note why we could be a good match. I will get back to you this time, promise.</p>
