I"_<p>I like traveling by public transport.</p>

<p>Aside from accidentally hearing Game of Thrones spoilers, I sometimes get to overhear design and creative chats. The benefits of the Shipley to Leeds commute, eh.</p>

<p>I earwigged a conversation the other day, the general gist was creating visuals in Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”, whatever the circumstance.</p>

<p>The only way. To create. A good prototype.</p>

<p>A good prototype.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype">the definition of <em>prototype</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prototypes are there to allow you to explore an idea, a thought, a theory, an approach. How that prototype manifests is totally up to you.</p>

<p>Photoshop is cool. As are all the various other ways: paper and pens, Pop, Marvel, Sketch, Keynote, using a code framework, acting, and so on.</p>

<p>If you are more comfortable with a certain way of prototyping over everything else, great, good for you. But there is no <em>one way</em> to creating prototypes, let alone <em>one way</em> to create a “good prototype”.</p>

<p>A “good prototype” takes into account what we are exploring. If we are exploring a particular medium then maybe Photoshop is the only way to create a “good prototype”. But, again, Photoshop over Sketch, Keynote etc? Photoshop is not the <em>only way</em>.</p>

<p>A prototype is something you create with all the tools from your own creative toolbox. It doesn’t need to be <em>beautiful</em>. Use what’s right for you and right for your project.</p>

<p>If you think there’s only one way to do “good prototypes”, then get real. Get prototyping your prototyping.</p>
