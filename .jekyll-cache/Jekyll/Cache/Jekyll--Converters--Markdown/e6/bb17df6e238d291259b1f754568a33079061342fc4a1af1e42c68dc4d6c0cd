I"è<p>A couple of months back my daughter, my twelve-year-old daughter, went off on one. Threw a benny. Actually laid into me right proper.</p>

<p>â€œWhy are you here? Youâ€™re never here. Youâ€™re always <em>working</em>,â€ she screamed, scarily.</p>

<p>â€œWhy are you here now? We donâ€™t need you here. We manage without you. <em>And</em> even when you are here youâ€™re never happy.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, <em>Iâ€™m</em> not happy, dad. Youâ€™re never about. And we canâ€™t go on holiday together this year because of your stupid job. What is the point of you being a dad?â€</p>

<p>She was right, and is right. Iâ€™ve always worked long hours, worked late - but I always tried to make weekends sacrosanct. I was now working every hour I could be awake, but at some point it would be worth it. The hope, eh.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d had to miss the kidsâ€™ trip to Euro Disney at Easter. And itâ€™s looking like I was going to miss the summer holiday as well.</p>

<p>And now I had my daughterâ€™s reality check. Working every hour I could be awake â€” and not getting much back.</p>

<p>(Ironically this episode was days after I put up a post called <a href="/the-studio-nearly-one-year-on">Doing My Own Thing: One Year On</a>.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Last week I was with my son on a school trip. He and his mates were talking.</p>

<p>â€œWhat does your dad do?â€ one of Nateâ€™s mates asked.</p>

<p>Nate told them about how I design stuff, â€œmaking websites, using the internet and all sorts of neat devicesâ€, and â€œhe stands at the front of rooms to talk and people listenâ€, and he goes into some detail about a couple of things. And they all go â€œCOOL!â€</p>

<p>For a second I see my son is proud. I am the cool dad. I am the dad that does the things that make a difference.</p>

<p>But I remember what my daughter said. Whatâ€™s the point in being a <em>dad</em>?</p>

<p>And then I remember something else: I donâ€™t do the â€œcool stuffâ€ <em>that</em> much. I do bits and pieces. I sure wouldnâ€™t expect to do the â€œcool stuffâ€ all the time. I was reminded that Doing My Own Thing doesnâ€™t mean I Am Doing What I Want To Do. I am reminded again I am doing this, whatever it is I do because no-one (in the Leeds area) will take me on. Iâ€™m â€œtoo senior for this positionâ€ to â€œI cannot see how youâ€™ll fit inâ€. (Or probably too shit or tainted or whatever.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Iâ€™ve given it my all for the past year-and-a-bit, absolutely everything, taken to the brink. A fortnight back I talked to the businessâ€™s bank. Iâ€™d been working towards this the past year.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I heard back from the bank, they wouldnâ€™t support the businessâ€™s plan to grow. Iâ€™ve always known running something is hard, and when youâ€™re the only director of a small business it would be harder still. It has been hard. But the plan was to get me some mental room, some time back.</p>

<p>And with that letter back I saw I would have to keep on as I have. It isnâ€™t sustainable. And I decided that everything Iâ€™d given wasnâ€™t worth it.</p>

<hr />

<p>A couple of weeks back I was told about the outcomes of a report I had written for the NHS, the report had been used to do this and that. It felt good, so good. <em>This</em> is why I am doing my own thing, to have an effect on people â€“ and being paid to do it.</p>

<p>The recent <a href="/look-up-your-amazon-wish-list-in-a-local-library">Amazon wishlist look up tool</a> had an amazing response. I did it for nothing, albeit in my spare time. The more interesting stuff I seem to have done on that basis. Itâ€™s fun, it gets peopleâ€™s attention, but it doesnâ€™t lead to anything, it doesnâ€™t pay the bills.</p>

<p>When people ask for me for a couple of hours â€œto go through somethingâ€ I check what for, and usually say as a freelancer I charge for that. Most of the time the chat didnâ€™t happen. (Anyone of the lunchtime natter posse, youâ€™re cool. Thatâ€™s what lunches are for.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the past couple of months Iâ€™ve had a couple of tentative queries about full time roles, reminders I am at my best â€œin a bigger organisationâ€, etc. I havenâ€™t taken them any further, but this is more than what happened when I left Home last year and Bloom the year before that. I havenâ€™t taken the offers that seriously, â€œIâ€™m doing my own thingâ€, remember.</p>

<p>But now I am: I will listen and look.</p>

<p>Late last week I decided that Iâ€™ll keep freelancing (as thatâ€™s what I basically do as the studio) in the short term (got some small stuff on, yo) but Iâ€™ll start looking around properly for something else full time. Thereâ€™s some local stuff - maybe Iâ€™ll hit the same barriers as before, maybe not.</p>

<p>If I was some savvy American business person Iâ€™d say I was doing a <em>pivot</em>. But, Iâ€™m not that guy or gal. Iâ€™m just a refocusing on what I really want to do and what I really need to do. It seems a good time with the workflow, weâ€™re in a plateau. Weâ€™re winding down â€œthe studioâ€.</p>

<p>It is painful, it is very painful with everything I (and Michael) have put in, it is really painful with everything I (and Michael) have given up and gone without, and it is painful for other people as well.</p>

<p>I have done a lot the past year, I have grown, and developed even more, worked with some great people to do some great work, and survived. But I cannot keep on at this rate. I need to be a <em>dad</em> for my kids, and a <em>husband</em> for my long-suffering wife. I need a change for the change I need.</p>

<p>But also, as a family, we sat down and have decided something that we all want together: That I look further, that we look further. To Manchester. To London. To further than those even.</p>

<p>I hope as a person who believes in this area there is something. With my past employment experience here and knowledge of what there is I believe maybe. But with my recent experience I am not hopeful. And if there isnâ€™t? As a family we all acknowledge if that thing out there for me, for us, is further we will go for it.</p>

<p>Boom, as the kids say.</p>
