<p>Running target for 2019: 1092 kilometres</p>

<p>Total distance ran so far in 2019: 1013 kilometres</p>

<p>Recorded in <a href="https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0cWhQqgPDF2FKXSnUdB79lWVw#2019_running">my little tracking spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-september-2019-went">How September 2019 went</h3>

<p>Goal: <strong>Go for a run five days every week. (Basically: Clock 20 runs in September.)</strong></p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ A difficult month to get out running (more to follow in the words). I ended up running 15 times.</p>

<p>Goal: <strong>Try some fartlek amongst the longer runs, hopefully once a week, but at least twice in September.</strong></p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ I had a couple of goes at fartlek.</p>

<p>Goal: <strong>If I can do 100 kilometres in September, Iâ€™d be happy.</strong></p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ I ran 136 kilometres, so ğŸ™‚. Thatâ€™s brings up 1149 kilometres for the year so far, passing my 1092 target for the year.</p>

<p>Goal: <strong>Keep enjoying it!</strong></p>

<p>ğŸ‘ğŸ¼ I am!</p>

<h3 id="the-words">The words</h3>

<p>A difficult month to be consistent with my runs.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t a terrible month for distance, knocking up 136 kilometres and for the week commencing 16 September I wracked up 55 kilometres.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/41247532/training/log?feature=last-4-weeks-calendar">My Strava log</a> shows I ran every Sunday, at least 10 kilometres. And I ran 15 times, which is once every two days. But thatâ€™s not quite how it played out. The middle of the weeks were barren with not a single run on a Wednesday or Thursday. To balance this a little Iâ€™ve been climbing midweek every week, but it would have been nice to do a little more. Too many longer stretches with no runs, I could have done with more smaller bits and pieces here and there. A run every three days at worst would have been nice. Something to aim for for October!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working away a bit, but in <a href="run-notes-2019-june/">June</a>, <a href="run-notes-2019-july/">July</a> and <a href="run-notes-2019-august/">August</a> I was too and managed to get in some decent amounts of running. Iâ€™ve had some tough weeks of work, but earlier this year Iâ€™d use running as an opportunity to make up for being sat at a desk or getting stuck in a mental rut.</p>

<p>The hotel I usually stay at when working away has a gym and treadmills, but Iâ€™ve shied away from them. At the start of the year treadmills had got my fitness up. Maybe Iâ€™ve gone too far into avoiding treadmills since Iâ€™ve focused on running outside. As October will roll on the nights will roll in earlier, so embracing the â€˜mill needs to be a must.</p>

<p>Lots of highlights the month with lots of Discoveries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Starting the month with <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2670004296">10.18km in just under 54 minutes</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2689896075">A first trek along the River Aire</a> once I got to Rodley. On a previous run I saw a path just after the bridge behind the Railway pub so I thought Iâ€™d have a gander. A cracking little trail to get onto!</li>
  <li>An <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2696665066">explore of the woods to the north of Calverley</a>.</li>
  <li>Going over the river Aire closer to home I had my <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2710148143">first venture through Esholt Woods</a>, through Yeadon discovering the cycle way, and back down to the woods.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2713637392">first run across to and through Esholt</a>, during a long lunch break.</li>
  <li>An <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2717565577">after-work jaunt out towards Sunniside</a> near Newcastle. Some nice road and track running (thereâ€™s loads of great tracks round Newcastle, a few seem to be over old rail routes). The last 20 minutes or so were in the pitch black, so I had my phone light on through its holder.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2726789057">Exploring the woods south of Calverley</a>.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2730078535">Sunday 20k-er</a>, stitching together two loops I had tried, up to Yeadon through Esholt Woods then back down to the canal and out to Rodley and back along the Aire.</li>
  <li>Another combiner of loops, but this time cutting one loop down. And the second half I enjoyed <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2749696601">running along the Aire</a>, with the river running very high after the recent downpours. At one point the river was covering the path so I had to wade through. Also chance to give my new Nike Wildhorses out. Fun stuff!</li>
</ul>

<p>I read an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/tomevansultra">Tom Evans</a> saying not to swing your arms as much when going uphill, limiting the movement so your arms donâ€™t go out in front of your chest. I tried it a few times in the second half of the month and combined with smaller strides my movement up hills seemed to <em>feel</em> better.</p>

<p>Actually, September seemed a bit more hilly than usual. Elevation was 1663m, which was well up on August (when I felt Iâ€™d done quite a bit of hill running upstate in New York, but didnâ€™t seem to have). I donâ€™t feel as shagged going up hills now than I did back in the first half of the year, which again feels like progress.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, I bagged a place on the Percy Pud 10k in Sheffield in early December. Maybe a race is what I need to focus me a little more.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been dabbling in some yoga to see if it can free up my legs a little. My hamstrings feel tight a bit so Iâ€™ve been giving it a go. Thanks to James Boardwell who seemed to be reading my mind pointing me towards <a href="https://instagram.com/runbetterwithyoga?igshid=wenkdkq46iqi">Run Better With Yoga</a>.</p>

<h3 id="goals-for-october">Goals for October</h3>

<p>Run three times a week, at least.</p>

<p>Run every other day if possible.</p>

<p>Run at least 100 kilometres. See if I can get close to that stretch goal of 1302 for the year.</p>

<p>Embrace the treadmill!</p>

<p>Enjoy it still!</p>
