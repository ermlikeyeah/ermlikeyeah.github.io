I"Ù<p>Itâ€™s only a month since we were <a href="http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/public-design-wy-number-two-done/">saying thanks and goodbye to Public Design WY #2</a>.</p>

<p>And now itâ€™s time to wrap up Public Design WY #3.</p>

<p>Held in the awesome DHEZ / Digital Catapult Centre Yorkshire space in Bradford, it was personally a great moment to hold a meet in the city I live in, to talk abut design, and hear about how the cityâ€™s council are designing services.</p>

<p>Without Ian Sharpâ€™s wonderful open offer to hold something there we would never have had the chance. Thank you, Ian.</p>

<p>The sessions were a great dive into how Bradford council is shaping its services, open and honest in their content.</p>

<p>We heard from Alex Leslie and Jan Blum from FutureGov about the service design work theyâ€™ve been helping Bradford Council with around social housing.</p>

<p>Bringing design thinking into the council, designing round peopleâ€™s individual needs, working collaboratively as a collective team to prototype ideas, and being pragmatic as designers were strong points that came through. And the FutureGov team werenâ€™t talking about what they wanted to do â€“Â this was talking about what they had done.</p>

<p>Helen Valentine gave us a great session on the challenges, reliefs, and joy of content design on the continually improving <a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk">bradford.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Some things Helen talked about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The councilâ€™s <a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/app">app</a></li>
  <li>A post <a href="https://bradfordmdc.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/we-are-ready-to-switch-off-our-old-website/">We Are Ready To Switch Off Our Old Website</a></li>
  <li>Some great notes on <a href="https://bradfordmdc.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/reviewing-content-for-our-new-website/">Reviewing Content For Our New Website</a></li>
  <li>Al Freemanâ€™s post on <a href="https://albfreeman.wordpress.com/2015/02/26/google-is-our-homepage/">Google Is Our Homepage</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Helenâ€™s session provoked some great support on Twitter when I shared her thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write content for everyone, whatever their situation and their abilities or disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s a challenge, but Helen and the team are making headway and gaining support.</p>

<p>Helen also closed off her session asking for help and advice for things she can do or use to further this work. We are really trying to make these meets a place where collaboration and sharing happen. It was heartening that Helen knew she could ask for this at the meet, and people responded.</p>

<p>Another other side is hearing how the meets are helping people with their work. Several people have told about what they learnt at Phil Sherryâ€™s session on accessibility at [Public Design WY #2], and how they are already on making things better at their workplaces. Thumbs up.</p>

<p>If you are curious about the It Looks Like A Frozen Sausage post I wrote that started my chat with the team working on the Bradford council website you <a href="http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/it-looks-like-a-frozen-sausage/">can read it</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/local-gov-sticker/">learn more</a> about the stickers I did for the councilâ€™s web team to mark the launch of their beta site earlier last year.</p>

<p>The slides I did for the meet are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16YEeLfhkpDgDU46l2biOU94sGcNgWeoUOEVGcU9-Z5s/edit?usp=sharing">on Google Drive</a>.</p>

<p>Public Design #4 is already booked in. Thereâ€™s no meet in August, but weâ€™ll be back on Tuesday 12th September at Futurelabs in Leeds. We are working out the details of the meet at the moment, but weâ€™ll let you know later in August. You can register to come along <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/241720125/">over at Meetup</a>. And we are going to try to do another Public Design WY in Bradford soon after. Fingers crossed!</p>

<p>Thanks for all your support so far. Have a great summer. See you in September!</p>
