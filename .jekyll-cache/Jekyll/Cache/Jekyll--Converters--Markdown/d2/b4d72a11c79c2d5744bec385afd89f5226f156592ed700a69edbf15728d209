I"¡<p>A bit of tick-tocking-along week in the day job. Nothing really to report. Stuff is happening. Most of the more eye-catching stuff day job stuff involved the mothership. Most of the more mind catching stuff for me happened outside of the day job â€“ and these notes ainâ€™t about that.</p>

<p>Thursday was a trip to Sheffield (probably my second favourite UK city) for the cross government design meeting. The highest number of â€˜heads ofâ€™ updates, and some interesting themes around design consolidation and the idea of â€œdesign cultureâ€.</p>

<p>The former seems to be happening over a few bits of gov. Weâ€™ve gone wide, letâ€™s take some time to rationalise our work. Sensible.</p>

<p>The mentions of supporting design, supporting design culture, and supporting a design led culture also peppered the discussion. â€˜Cultureâ€™ is a strong word, that mix of people and environment. Some good chats, but was clear that just about every government department there valued user centred design and gave it a â€œseat at the tableâ€.</p>

<p>The redesigned radio and checkboxes that the team at GDS have been working on have <a href="//designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk/">been rolled out further</a>. Weâ€™ve been using them for nearly two months now in our NHS.UK â€œconnecting to servicesâ€ and â€œregister with a GPâ€ work. Is it too much effort to do the work to overwrite browserâ€™s default stylings so we have web interfaces that are designed for everyone? No. Maybe look at it the other way: Why donâ€™t browsers come with form elements styled from this thinking out the box?</p>

<p>The <a href="//gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/building-better-assessments-for-digital-services/">revamp of the assessments of government services</a> was a good way to start the week. I <a href="//www.ermlikeyeah.com/continual-assessments/">blogged earlier this year</a> on having more frequent contact with â€œguidersâ€ (rather than assessors), and seeing this approach getting out there feels a good thing. Some teams, some services, some bits of gov will need it more than others, but feels a step in the right direction of helping those who need help not surface after months of work, fail their assessment, and go back to the heat of their department. â€˜Failâ€™ is a strong word to take back to your bosses innit.</p>

<p>â€œWe want to empower teams across government to look at accessibility as an intrinsic part of end-to-end service design.â€ Thatâ€™s the TL;DR of <a href="//accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/02/how-to-make-accessibility-easier-for-service-teams/">a cracking blog post</a> on how to make accessibility easier for service teams.</p>

<p>This week marked six months on NHS.UK beta. I took some time to do a six month review of that time. These week notes (which I have in longer form off-line) helped me take stock. Coming a few days after the cross gov meeting and seeing where government departments are at was probably not the best time to â€“ but itâ€™s progress. These things take time, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyway. <a href="//vimeo.com/122537489">Hereâ€™s Michael Bierut talking about the loneliness of designing and the primitive power of logos</a>.</p>
