I"z<p>This past Saturday I took time out from my weekend to inhabit that fuzzy space between “work” and “play”, this time helping out at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/leeds-hyperlocal-march-tickets-16034054288">Leeds Young Rewired State Hyperlocal gig</a> held at Leeds library. Some quick thoughts on that - before time and the event races away from me!</p>
