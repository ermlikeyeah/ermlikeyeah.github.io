I"ª<p><a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-1">Previously I left off</a> at the pause in my diagnosis journey of <em>waiting for a call to talk about my test results</em>. At the end of the appointment the nurse was clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weâ€™ll send these samples off</li>
  <li>The results will be back by Friday</li>
  <li>I will call you on that day</li>
  <li>â€œCan I check you phone number [peers at screen] ends in XXXX? Yes? OK.â€</li>
  <li>â€œWeâ€™ll speak on Friday.â€</li>
</ul>

<p>There is nothing more I can do other than carry on carrying on, put it to the back of my mind. I can compartmentalise things like that, bury them away. Itâ€™s a good thing in a way, letâ€™s me focus, and at times itâ€™s been a bad thing. I had plenty else to occupy my mind but for the next few days itâ€™ll stop any possible distractions. Friday it is.</p>

<hr />

<p>I write <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/diabetes-1">my first note on my diabetes journey</a>. I share it on my blog and on Twitter. A few people get in touch, a couple to say (which is quite rare for these sorts of notes) <em>Iâ€™ll be reading these with interest becauseâ€¦</em>. Itâ€™s like a little network. Someone gets in touch to say theyâ€™re going to see their GP for a health check. Iâ€™ve joked before a KPI for me is every time I share something it makes one person take a moment to think whether they are OK too â€” and if theyâ€™re not do go see your doctor. A couple of people ask how Iâ€™m doing, which is nice of them. <em>I am fine. I am the same as I was yesterday, the day before, the week before, and the year before.</em> Nothing has changed. Iâ€™ve been living my life in ways that are good for my body and mind for a over a year. The only thing is now is just finding out how medicine can help me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Friday â€” yesterday â€” is the day I am not compartmentalising. Today is the day I get the call. I was on a train early on, working remotely for the day.</p>

<p>On Friday my phone rang three times. Most of my chats are through video software on my computer, so when my phone rings a) itâ€™s rare, and b) itâ€™s usually for personal stuff.</p>

<p>Every time I heard the ring I picked up my phone. I do what I always do: I look at the screen and see if my phone recognises the number or if I recognise the number. If I donâ€™t recognise the number I usually just let it ring out. Theyâ€™ll leave a message if itâ€™s a useful call. Two calls definitely werenâ€™t the doctorâ€™s surgery. One of the numbers I didnâ€™t recognise. I expected the doctorâ€™s surgery to be a Bradford number not a Leeds one. I was caught between leave it or answer it. I left it. The message was from the receptionist at my dentist.</p>

<p>I shut down from working at 4pm. Iâ€™d yet to receive the call. It never comes.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the start of yesterday I thought Iâ€™d have some idea of the next move. But at the moment I donâ€™t.</p>

<p>In work I do a lot of/about mapping out journeys. <em>Steps</em> is the word commonly used to describe the individual things people do as they move along the journeys we map out.</p>

<p><em>Steps</em> in the journey can be reductionery in understanding what someone goes through in their current moment. Itâ€™s not a step to them. It is just the present. When a date and a time is given like I had, mentally you start to form around that moment. What will happen then? What could happen next? <em>Movement</em> not a step. What will the next <em>move</em> be?</p>

<p>I did a little of that â€” mentally going through some possibilities â€” yesterday when it came. I came out of the day not knowing. I now have to go through that again another day. The only difference is I donâ€™t know when that will be.</p>
