<p>Weâ€™re looking ahead to what we do for the service jams in Leeds over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Already thereâ€™s the Global Service Jam sneaking up on us in two months, starting after work on Friday 9 March and continuing over the weekend.</p>

<p>Three months later we have Leeds Gov Jam kicking off on the evening of Tuesday 5 June, followed by two days of jamming.</p>

<p>This will be the fourth year out of five Iâ€™ve helped with the service jams. They are always great places to learn about service design, something I am massively enthusiastic about and massively believe in. The jams are also great places to help people learn about service design. It is never a chore helping out!</p>

<p>Whatever you are doing â€“Â a student, already doing design for a living, thinking of design as a career move, fancy trying working with some new acquaintances, or just curious - youâ€™ll spend a few days in a room full of equally curious people wanting to find out what works â€“Â and what doesnâ€™t work â€“ in a space safe for experimenting.</p>

<p>To help us plan for this year weâ€™ve set up a little form, to help us understand who is interested, and how youâ€™d be interested. Whether you want to come along and jam or come along and help out weâ€™d like to know. Youâ€™ll also be the first to hear the details of the jams. You can <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/B9yvPQrt9WWBUt3D2">find the form here</a>.</p>

<p>I blogged about the <a href="/leeds-govjam-2014/">2014 jam</a>, the <a href="/leeds-govjam-2015-in-just-three-points/">2015 jam</a>, sat out 2016 (because Iâ€™d recently joined the then-NHS Beta programme and work was full on), and last year I blogged about <a href="/mvp-questions/">Is your minimum viable product viable?</a> following my opening night lightning talk â€“Â and about when Kathryn and I did <a href="/accidental-slogans-personas/">an accidental slogan</a>.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll find a wealth of info on the jams over on the <a href="https://gsjleeds.wordpress.com">Leeds Service Jam website</a> and the <a href="www.leedsgovjam.com">Leeds Gov Jam site</a>/. Weâ€™ll also be blogging over on those websites in the next week or so about what we are planning â€“ and also explaining the difference between the two jams. Stay tuned!</p>
