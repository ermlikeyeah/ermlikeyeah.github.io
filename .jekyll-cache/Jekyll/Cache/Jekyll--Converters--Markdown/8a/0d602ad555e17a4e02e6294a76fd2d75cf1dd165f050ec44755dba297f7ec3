<h3 id="friday-1-november">Friday 1 November</h3>

<p>On Friday I wrote <a href="/run-notes-2019-october/">my run notes for October</a>. I noted some goals for November. A little planning just helps. Some goals for the months. Then most weeks I add some detail, work out what running I plan to do for the coming week or two.</p>

<p>For November I thought itâ€™d be interesting to jot down and publish my run notes weekly rather than just doing one note for the whole month. It is just an experiment. If there is anything youâ€™d find interesting drop me a line and Iâ€™ll try to work it in.</p>

<p>Friday was a day of no running though, not even a visit to the gym. There was some sledging at Xscape near Castleford, but it doesnâ€™t really count. Also rest is OK.</p>

<h3 id="saturday-2-november">Saturday 2 November</h3>

<p>A great thing about where we live: There are lots of long roads nearby, a canal with a decent towpath alongside, and plenty of tracks and trails through the many woods nearby.</p>

<p>Saturday mornings are usually when the dog needs A Bit Of A Walk. Earlier this year Iâ€™d take the dog along the canal, but after a couple of runs when Scrogs came back with poorly paw pads I had to rethink my Saturday mornings with her. The dog likes grass fields and woodland and over the past month or so Iâ€™ve been exploring the woodland north of the River Aire near us, specifically around Esholt Woods. Itâ€™s only been the past few weekends I have come to peace with going out with the dog to the woods and at a pace the dog is happy with.</p>

<p>The past few weekends have also tended to be wet. This Saturday wasnâ€™t any different. I am glad I have a pair of Nike Wildhorses for sloppy conditions!</p>

<h4 id="bradford-city-runs-10km">Bradford City Runs 10km</h4>

<p>I only entered this 10km on Thursday, having seen the race when looking into some future races. There were a few races listed for the day â€“ 5km, 10km, 10 miles, half a marathon â€“ which all rely on <a href="http://www.bradfordcityruns.co.uk/maps/maps.html">the same 5km loop</a>.</p>

<p>At the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2820478821/overview">Leeds Abbey Dash last week</a> I found being in a race made me grind through the kilometres in a way Iâ€™d not done before. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Racing amongst other people isnâ€™t something I am too up on, the Abbey Dash and the Leeds half marathon all I have done.</p>

<p>I live in Bradford so itâ€™s a home run. I also know the course wasnâ€™t going to be as flat or fast as the Abbey Dash, where I ran 50:48. What would some hills do to me? So I fancied another 10km to compare.</p>

<p>It was the first run with my Hoka One One Clifton 6s and some merino gloves, but thatâ€™s by the by.</p>

<p>The start of the race wasnâ€™t the best: It wasnâ€™t clear when the 10km race had started so I was one of the last out and a little fumbling. But once I was off it was steady away. Until I turned off Thornton Road onto Longside Lane, which was a climb uphill. I took it alright, shorter strides and limiting my arm movement.</p>

<p>Turning onto Shearbridge Road meant I knew running down Great Horton Road next would be downhill, the chance for some springy strides to get my pace up a bit. After the plateau through the city centre, past the Westfield shopping centre, the climb in Little Germany was a grind â€” and over cobbled roads in places â€” with the weaving up to Peckover Street sapping. But again, once at the top you know thereâ€™s a bounce down. Hitting the level roads again meant it was steady away until getting to Longside Lane again.</p>

<p>About 6km near the top of Longside Lane the back of my right leg started to tighten and hurt, eventually the pain being considerable with a couple of kilometres to go. I had to stop to stretch it out at one point. I clenched my teeth and fists and pounded on, but it was agony. My pace dropped in those last two kilometres. As the chance of hitting sub-50 had faded on Great Horton Road, I was happy to just finish and finish as close to 50 minutes as I could given the pain.</p>

<p>I found the difference in actually racing rather than going for a run come through again though. For the last four kilometres of my race Iâ€™d been swapping places with a woman in a red Park Run 50 top. With half a kilometre to go I was behind again but wanted to be closer to 50 minutes than 55 minutes. I focused and tried to ignore the pain, starting to pick the pace up as much as I could, steadily trying to catch her up. I passed her as we came onto the paving of City Park, with about 300 metres to go, and kept pushing as hard as I could.</p>

<p>Crossing the finish line I was just thankful Iâ€™d actually crossed the line running, not walking, and not having given up when I stopped to stretch the leg out. I didnâ€™t stop moving when I crossed the line, walking away from the line. After 15 seconds I had to stop, leant over for a few minutes to let the pain in my leg take over me, deep breaths, collect my body again, and then walked over to get my bag.</p>

<p>51 minutes and 41 seconds was my chip time. Iâ€™d have taken 55 minutes beforehand given the hills. Against my 50:48 for the flat Abbey Dash, factor in the hills and the leg, that feels an improvement. Maybe that sub-50 is doable.</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>

<p>I am working away for a few days of the week. This means two overnight stays in Newcastle. I usually play what I do a little by ear but have a rough plan. I have two evenings and two mornings to do something. Thereâ€™s a gym at the hotel. Thereâ€™s well lit roads nearby. Thereâ€™s a good chance of a 8km run and a 5km run over those days. the hotel room is quite roomy so a chance for some stretches and yoga (thanks to James Boardwell for pointing me to something useful on that one).</p>

<p>Friday, I fancy a run out towards Esholt, which will probably be a long lunch affair. Down to over the river, along the track, and then onto the quiet roads through the village. Steady though because on Saturday I have another race, arrrgghh.</p>

<p>Sunday Iâ€™ll be having off as Iâ€™m away at a gig Saturday night. This means a little planning for the weekend if I wanted to do a run: Iâ€™ve got a place on <a href="https://racebest.com/races/v359c">the Holly Hustle 11km in Meanwood</a> on the Saturday. Looks a bit dirtier than the road races of the past two weekends. Oooo, dirty.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve added to some more runs to my list of runs <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgqrIMV4wFNBrZzFrWuq53eD0olrjSKbJM">in Evernote</a> I am looking at and doing in 2020. The list is openly available for anyone to look at.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/ACjENOzV1QRHw5jl7sxc7IzNk6mtpB2RxPU">hit list of runs to do</a> which is also openly available. If thereâ€™s any races or runs you recommend please me know!</p>

<p>Question: How do you plan your running week?</p>

<p>See you in a week!</p>
