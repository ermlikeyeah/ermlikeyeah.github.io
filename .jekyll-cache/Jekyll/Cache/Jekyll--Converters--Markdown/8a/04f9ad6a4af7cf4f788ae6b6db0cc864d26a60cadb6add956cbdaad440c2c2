<p>It‚Äôs a couple of weeks back. It‚Äôs a weekday morning, about half seven. I‚Äôve been staying over in a hotel, and sat eating breakfast at a table on my own.</p>

<h4 id="2">2</h4>
<p>Times like this I am usually lost in <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> on my phone, catching up on news and stuff. It‚Äôs not unusual. There‚Äôs usually the murmur from other tables. Between articles I catch snippets. Most of the time I do have a quick listen. It‚Äôs easy to be curious, eh?</p>

<p>But most of the time I go back to Feedly while I eat and drink.</p>

<h4 id="3">3</h4>
<p>This morning I am between articles. I hear the murmurs from the next table. These guys are up from London, they‚Äôre going into somewhere to today to check on something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They‚Äôre contractors. They‚Äôre not invested. They don‚Äôt care. They turn up, do their thing, do their hours, clock out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chaps continued on. They took contractors are a mass, a whole, and applied these rules.</p>

<p>The last thing I overheard those chaps say before I left ‚Äì having finished my breakfast rather than a sense of weariness in what they were saying ‚Äì was how contractors aren‚Äôt there forever. ‚ÄúFull time staff‚Äù were presented as people who would never leave their place of work.</p>

<h4 id="4">4</h4>
<p>I walk into work, thinking about what I overheard.</p>

<p>Sometimes I say I am an ‚Äúaccidental freelancer‚Äù. I freelance/contract because I need to work. When there‚Äôs no full time roles for you you look at other ways of working. So, at the mo freelance/contract work keeps me busy, in work, and being paid.</p>

<p>When I am place though I treat it as <em>my job</em> though. I‚Äôve spent most of my years working in agencies. That means the work comes first. And I want the work I do to be the best it can be. This means I‚Äôve given up a lot of my ‚Äúown time‚Äù.</p>

<p>I wonder on my way into work if those guys are actually talking about an approach to work that I should maybe embrace more.</p>

<p>Care less, not be emotionally invested.</p>

<p>Just do the hours.</p>

<p>Stick to just my role.</p>

<p>I get in for 8.45. By half nine I‚Äôve forgotten about those guys. I am into the work in hand.</p>

<p>After work that day, I finish at half six. Over the past three months I‚Äôve been back to the world of doing timesheets. I am supposed to record 37 hours a week, but easily rack up at least a day‚Äôs more time every week (which I don‚Äôt get paid for). I think back to those guys over breakfast.</p>

<p>Maybe they do have a point.</p>

<h4 id="5">5</h4>
<p>A few days after overhearing these chaps talk I am out for an unwind with some of the other designers.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre swapping problems, solutions, things we want to do, things we could do, laughs, rants, enthusiasms ‚Äì over a couple of ales and a burger.</p>

<p>I hear what the other guys are saying.</p>

<p>They‚Äôve also been putting in more hours than we‚Äôre supposed to. They frequently break from the ‚Äú9 to 5‚Äù at short notice to do a late one.</p>

<p>A lot of us are cut from the agency cloth. We know sometimes we have to go the extra proverbial mile to get shit done. We just get on with it. Most of us are used to that disruption to our days, our lives. (Disclosure: Sometimes we are actually asked to make sure we get back our extra time in lieu which is one up on most agencies we‚Äôve ever worked in.)</p>

<p>We talk about the things we want the design community where we work to be, how we can contribute. We talk about how we can use our experience. We talk about how we want to mentor the placement students. We work out ways we can work closer with the content designers, with the user researchers, with the business analysts, with the front-enders, with everyone.</p>

<p>At one point there‚Äôs the suggestion we should get a megaphone and stand at one end of the atrium and declare a manifesto with design at the centre (because <a href="/design-is-teamwork">design is the team‚Äôs work</a>). Eeee, ales, eh.</p>

<p>But why the fuck not?</p>

<h4 id="6">6</h4>
<p>During the evening not one of us mentions anything about how we are only where we are until a certain point, when the contract runs out. We talk about what we do as a job, which we turn up to every day. Which we do. To us it is our job. We are paid to turn up, and we want to contribute.</p>

<p>You might already be forming the point as contractors that we are paid ‚Äúalright‚Äù. But if working where we are was about money first and foremost most of us acknowledged we‚Äôd be somewhere else. Probably places in London, not spending the best past of the marooned away from our families.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre there because we want to do good work, for the people, with our colleagues. We want to use our experience and our skills to work better all round. We can see the potential of what that place can bring.</p>

<p>And I realise <em>we</em> are the antithesis to those guys at breakfast.</p>

<h4 id="7">7</h4>
<p>Some of us have started to talk about enjoying it so much we‚Äôre looking at how at some point we can become designers within government ‚Äúfull time‚Äù.</p>

<p>Some of it is to keep a good thing going, the other is to get out of the ‚Äúcontractor avoidance‚Äù that hangs around a little, how there‚Äôs certain thing we cannot do because we‚Äôre not full time civil servants.</p>

<p>For me, it‚Äôs the best job I‚Äôve had since my Brahm days. And I have had some <em>really</em> good jobs.</p>

<p>And here‚Äôs the crux for me: Whether they are contractors or full time, isn‚Äôt it a good thing we have good thinkers, good makers, good designers, who give a shit, a <em>good team</em> doing the work? Especially in an enviornment that is so design centric, that gives permission to do good design, and needs good design?</p>

<p>And assembling a <em>good team</em> in the first place is hard, believe me.</p>

<h4 id="8">8</h4>
<p>Those guys at that breakfast table? Later that day I see them walking about where I work. I have no beef with them, or people who think like that. I am on with my thing. They‚Äôre on with their thing.</p>

<p>Still, proving they are wrong: Just another thing I could add to our list of things that will make where we work a better place. And maybe to people like that wherever they are.</p>

<p>Maybe this post will work towards that.</p>
