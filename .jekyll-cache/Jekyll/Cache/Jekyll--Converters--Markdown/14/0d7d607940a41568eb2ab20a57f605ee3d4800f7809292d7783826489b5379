I"É<p>I caught a little of Beverly Hills Cop on Netflix last night. Not seen it for a while, was talking to people about Richard Pryor the other week, led to talk about Eddie Murphy.</p>

<p>I pop the film on while Iâ€™ve a spare five minutes. A delicious opening. The Faltermeyer score. The eavesdropping-from-across-the-road shots of Detroit folk. And then at the end of the filmâ€™s intro credits, up pops this, the usual <em>Directed by</em>.</p>

<p>Just look at how that diagonal runs just off Brestâ€™s name. If itâ€™s a fluke, amazing. But there seems to have been some intent here. It looks lovely anyway. So Iâ€™ve grabbed it to share with you.</p>
