I"2<p>We are staying at Skegness Butlins.</p>

<p>I’ve got stuff to do while we are here. That stuff is on a computer. I’ll need to send stuff. I will need to access the wifi.</p>

<p>Using my iPhone I connect to the wifi. I need to choose an option.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi</li>
  <li>Use a voucher code to connect to the wifi</li>
  <li>Pay as you go for the wifi</li>
  <li>I’ve pre-paid for the wifi</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t know how 2 and 4 compare, but I haven’t bought any internet access. And I am going to need more than half an hour today, and more over the weekend. I plump for 3.</p>

<p>I read the page. I choose a “tariff” (£15 for four days), give some details (name, home address, email address), and go to the next screen. I provide some payment details. I click submit. Job done.</p>

<p>I then decide to connect my Macbook to the wifi. I get the same four options.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi</li>
  <li>Use a voucher code to connect to the wifi</li>
  <li>Pay as you go for the wifi</li>
  <li>I’ve pre-paid for the wifi</li>
</ol>

<p>Ah. I must have just bought a voucher code to connect to the internet. I click the option.</p>

<p>In smaller type I see <code class="highlighter-rouge">Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.</code></p>

<p>I open my email on the phone. I look at the email from Virgin, the wifi provider. I cannot clearly see a “voucher code”. I look again. Nope. Nothing. Hmmm.</p>

<p>I go back a page. I take in the options.</p>

<p>Maybe it is option 4:  I’ve pre-paid for the wifi.</p>

<p>Nope. And again <code class="highlighter-rouge">Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.</code></p>

<p>I go back to the options.</p>

<p>I click on option 1: Connect to 30 minutes of free wifi. This doesn’t tell me the service is not transferable. But also this option is for limited access does not requires a financial transaction.</p>

<p>I revisit option 3: Pay as you go for the wifi. Maybe I missed the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.</code> I didn’t. It’s not there. I nip back to the landing page. Nothing there either.</p>

<p>No warning to users along the journey, from the initial page to registration and payment, they are paying for wifi access for one device – in a moment when many people won’t think whether they can log on with another device. And in a place where families come to stay, there’s a strong likelihood of there being more than one device. It’s a fatal omission.</p>

<p>I did grabs of the screens.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/butlins-canvas.png" alt="Canvas of the screens for the wifi registration process at Butlins" /></p>

<p><a href="/assets/butlins-canvas.png">View a high resolution version of those screens.</a></p>

<p>Anyway. That exclusion of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Please note that the service is not transferable to a different device.</code> feels pretty sneaky, dark, even cynical money making omission. Humph.</p>
