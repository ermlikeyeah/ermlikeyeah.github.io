I"Ð<p>After <a href="/public-design-wy-number-one-done/">the first Public Design WY</a>, the only way forward was a second!</p>

<p>Unfortunately <a href="https://twitter.com/sophiedennis">Sophie Dennis</a> had to postpone her session on adventures in policy land, but we were still able to entertain and be entertained by <a href="https://twitter.com/nonswearyphil">Phil Sherry</a>. Phil works with HMRC, and trekked down from Newcastle to talk about accessibility.</p>

<p>When I heard about Philâ€™s talk (when he first did it at <a href="https://frontendne.co.uk">Frontend NE</a> a short while back) it sounded a good primer on accessibility as a thing you just do, with just enough technical stuff and examples to lift the lid for those curious to dive deeper.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a strong argument if you design inclusively then accessibility is usability. Donâ€™t see accessibility as some checkbox commitment or something to bolt on afterwards.</p>

<p>As Phil put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screen readers first, mobile, then desktop when designing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Philâ€™s session was one of the strongest Iâ€™ve seen in a long time with practical, pragmatic advice. If even one person that came to the meet-up learnt something and takes that into where they are, then job done.</p>

<p>Some tweets from the night were posted on Twitter with the hashtag. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23a11yatPDWY&amp;src=typd">see them here</a>, and feel free to speak to Phil over on Twitter.</p>

<p>Phil referenced a lot of sources. Heâ€™s <a href="https://philsherry.github.io/a11yatFNE/">put that list online</a> for people to refer to, and read through. Lots of great stuff in there. The slides from Philâ€™s original talk at Frontend NE - which he tweaked for the session with us in Leeds - are <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/frontendne/adventures-in-accessibility-testing">on Speakdeck</a>.</p>

<p>For what it is worth, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1edZ4P0gPiMDcH4NlyKOM9806ofTTfpwsV0V9d0GZYqo/edit?usp=sharing">my intro slides are also available</a> for wider use.</p>

<p>Thanks again, Phil, for making the effort to come down â€“Â and hopefully Sophie feels better soon.</p>

<p>A massive thanks to <a href="http://futurelabs.org.uk/">Futurelabs</a> for the space and everyone who came along. Neither are taken for granted.</p>

<p>If you came along to the meet-up you can leave feedback over <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239747499/">on Meetup</a> or <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>

<p>For the next Public Design WY weâ€™ll be heading over to Digital Health Enterprise Zone and Digital Catapult Yorkshire space in Bradford on Wednesday 12 July. Details are <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239752118/">over on Meetup</a>, and weâ€™ll be announcing later this week whoâ€™ll be leading the sessions there.</p>
