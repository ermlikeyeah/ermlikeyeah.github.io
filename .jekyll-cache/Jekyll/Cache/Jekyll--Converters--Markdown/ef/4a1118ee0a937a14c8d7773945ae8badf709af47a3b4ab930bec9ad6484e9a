I"¾<p>Half term, time for a proper little holiday for the first time in a long time. Time away from the current gig, time with the family, time to reflect on a few things, time to do some other stuff. Also, my 40th birthday was in there.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/eames-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I took full advantage of Birthday Privilege to drag the family to the Barbican for their <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18398">World of Ray and Charles Eames exhibition</a>.</p>

<p>In short: Excellent.</p>

<p>Lots to look at, watch, and read, including a full multi-screen recreation of <em><a href="http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/think/">Think!</a></em>. Two hours well spent in the breadth of the Eamesesâ€™ consistently excellent work and thinking. (Thereâ€™s <a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/october/ten-things-to-see-at-the-world-of-charles-and-ray-eames/">a solid overview on Creative Review</a>.)</p>

<p>Worth noting: The Barbicanâ€™s wall text and captions are <em>excellent</em>. I respectfully didnâ€™t take shots of any (instead writing notable excerpts on the back of our tickets). Thereâ€™s an excellent one at the top of this post.</p>

<p>And this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Girard">Alexander Girard</a> quote particularly struck a chord.</p>

<p>Handily, to save you deciphering my handwriting, the Barbican have now uploaded the wall text and captions to <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=18398">their website</a>. You can <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/media/events/18398theworldofcharlesrayeameswalltexts.pdf">view them on a PDF here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the wall texts had me coming away feeling I am not the only person seemingly concerned with the process of design. (Itâ€™s my little paranoia, and undercurrent in <a href="/mis-shapes">a recent post</a>.) So, thanks for whoever wrote that. Reaffirming.</p>

<p>Fellow process enquirers can view Charles Eamesâ€™ design process diagram <a href="http://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/charles-eames-design-process-diagram/">on the Eames Office website</a>.</p>
