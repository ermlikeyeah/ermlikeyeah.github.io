I"Å<p>$15 billion dollars. $18 billion dollars. Google offered $10 billion. That can buy a lot of other things. 450 million users, over 90% of which are users daily. Facebook are paying something like ‚Äú$42 per user‚Äù. 50 billion <em>Whatsapp</em> messages sent daily. 20 billion SMS messages sent daily. Something about youth usage of Whatsapp versus youth lack-of-usage of Facebook messaging. Top line stats, eh. You‚Äôll have read them already.</p>

<p>More interesting is talk about how Facebook will absorb Whatsapp. Will they? Is it such a certainty Facebook will just asorb Whatsapp, like an impulse themseles, Google, Yahoo! et al can‚Äôt resist? What is stopping Facebook <em>just owning</em> Whatsapp and leaving it to its own devices? Whatsapp‚Äôs got its own identity and audience already.</p>

<p>Also, would that be a smarter move? Facebook as a service is hefty, bloated and struggled to create slimmer, mono-focused offshoots. <em>Paper</em> was created by an innovation team that works in isolation as a specialised product team. Whatsapp has got where it has operating just like that, left to its own smartphone devices.</p>

<p>Also interesting is what other text message services are out there - and more importantly where.</p>

<p>Few noted (but <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/26/study-facebook-messenger-still-reigns-in-the-u-s-but-other-countries-look-to-whatsapp/">this research did back in November</a>) Facebook might be ahead in the United States as messenging app, but mostly across the world Whatsapp is nipping it.  Everyone wants to be the winner: in the lead, dominant.</p>

<p>I did say mostly. There are exceptions that break Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp usage.</p>

<p>In South Korea <em>Kakao</em> is the most popular messaging service in its home country (news today: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/21/korean-messaging-service-kakao-gets-ready-for-a-2-billion-ipo/">it is filing for an IPO</a>) - it is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-22/with-200-million-in-revenue-south-korea-s-top-messaging-app-is-all-smiley-faces.html">dominant</a>.</p>

<p>Japan‚Äôs <em>Line</em> has a reported 350 million users.</p>

<p>China has <em>WeChat</em> and <em>Sina Weibo</em> jostling for the eager attention of a huge population that continues to embrace what modern life can offer. But these guys are already huge in China.</p>

<p>What would they be if they moved outside of their domestic markets? (And I chuckle as I think about the idea of a ‚Äòdomestic market‚Äô on the internet.)</p>

<p>In similar acquisition news a week ago <a href="http://recode.net/2014/02/13/rakuten-buys-messaging-company-viber-for-900-million/">Japanese company Rakuten bought another message sending platform, <em>Viber</em>, for $900 million</a>. A platform that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/25/line-300m/">reportedly has 300 million users</a>, but failed to catch attention in any of the many articles, tables, charts and infographics around the Whatsapp purchase other than being ‚Äúbought‚Äù. Two-thirds the number of Whatsapp‚Äôs user base, and yet the sale/purchase of Viber generated nowhere near as much news, despite being part of a wider suite of (almost Yahoo!-esque) acquisitions by Rakuten.</p>

<p>All these (and more) to me are just as interesting as Whatsapp, especially when you consider their position within territories. What they lack is Whatsapp‚Äôs geographical usage spread - but even there are limits to where Whatsapp has usage/reach.</p>

<p>Will any team up? With each service having its own interface and own traffic network, unlikely. Will any merge? A possibility. But with so much choice for the audiences if one service was to die there are plenty more options.</p>

<p>And that last point is the most interesting for me. How do you, as a user, know which services - few or many - you should be on? We‚Äôve come a long way from just SMS through our phones as our text messaging service.</p>
