I"o<p>Ken Levine has announced <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5422846/bioshock-studio-irrational-games-closing">he is closing down Irrational Games</a>. The press is concentrating on Levine’s move - and there’s no doubt it is a move initiated by Levine - to <em>start a smaller, more entrepreneurial endeavour at Take-Two</em> that makes <em>replayable narrative-driven games that will only be released digitally</em> - and this new “start-up style studio” will be based at Take-Two, employing 15 (ex-) Irrational staff. The rest of the Irrational staff are being laid off. Irrational will be no more.</p>
