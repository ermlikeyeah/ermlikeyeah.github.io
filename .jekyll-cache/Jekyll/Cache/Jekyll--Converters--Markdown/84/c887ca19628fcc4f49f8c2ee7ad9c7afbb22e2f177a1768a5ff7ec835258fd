I"X<p>On the way to <a href="http://www.codalmighty.com/site/ca.php?article=6838">the football</a> yesterday I listened to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/08/29/643072388/episode-783-new-jersey-bails-out">an older Planet Money episode</a> (there is an update from now at the end of the podcast) on how New Jersey looked at bail reform.</p>

<p>The whole focus is on the person granted (or would be granted bail) and their circumstances – it is fascinating. Data, algorithms and therefore rules become involved. Lower prisoner numbers were floated as an outcome – but what effect suddenly stripping a system of all that money, how the system feeds into an industry? It’s fascinating stuff.</p>

<p>Half an hour, and give yourself a little timer afterwards to do some further digging on the internet afterwards.</p>

<p>And at the least you might learn – like I did – the difference between ‘jail’ and ‘prison’.</p>

<p>Listen to the podcast on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/08/29/643072388/episode-783-new-jersey-bails-out">NPR Planet Money website</a>.</p>
