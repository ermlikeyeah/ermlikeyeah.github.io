I"Á<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>Currently I am mainly contracting as a service designer for <a href="//difrent.co.uk">Difrent</a> on the NHS Jobs project at <a href="//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk">NHS BSA</a>, until May 2020. I am <a href="/work-note-2020-january/">figuring out what I will be doing after that date</a>.</p>

<p>I write <a href="/tags#weeknotes">week notes</a> which sometimes mention work and a more specific <a href="/tags#work%20notes">monthly work note</a>.</p>

<p>I coordinate the <a href="/leedsgovdesign/">Leeds gov design meets</a>, a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services. I am organising the next <a href="/leedsgovdesign">Leeds Gov Design</a> meet for early April 2020.</p>

<p>My upcoming speaking engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A public one, on accessible and inclusive products and services, at the next Product People North, Friday 15 May 2020</li>
  <li>A private one, on my running adventures in 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in me doing a session at your place of work or event, please get in touch. If you have something specific in mind that is a good start too.</p>

<p>I am planning on being at the following events. If you see me I am always happy to say hi and have a chat, so pleased do! If you are planning on going to one of these events and fancy a longer chat feel free to get in touch ahead of the event and we can see what we can do.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://2020.govservicedesign.net">Service Design in Government</a>, Edinburgh, Thursday 5 March 2020 only (not there the Wednesday and Friday)</li>
  <li><a href="https://disruptionsummit.co.uk/">Disruption Summit</a>, Leeds, Tuesday 24 March 2020</li>
  <li><a href="https://upfrontconf.com">Up Front</a>, Manchester, Friday 27 March 2020</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/2020/">Camp Digital</a>, Manchester, Wednesday 13 May 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently have no spare time to take on any further ‚Äúfull time‚Äù mentoring. Sorry. Three people is as many as I can help at the mo. If you just need an hour to chat with someone about work I could squeeze something in though.</p>

<p>If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
