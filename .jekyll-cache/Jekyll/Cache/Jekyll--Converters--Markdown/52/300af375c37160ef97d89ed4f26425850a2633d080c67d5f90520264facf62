I"~<p>I’ve not published any weeknotes from the day job for the past three weeks. <a href="//www.ermlikeyeah.com/weeknotes-s01e01/">At the start of November</a>,  I kicked off looking through my daily notes and cutting out the non-NHS beta stuff to publish an end-of-week look back on what me and the team had been doing. I’d been making the notes already and liked what <a href="//twitter.com/jukesie">Matt Jukes</a> was doing, publishing his notes. It seemed an easy win, keeping going the habit of working in the open that the NHS Alpha team was so good at a year or so back when I started mulling over leaving HMRC to join them.</p>
