I"¥<p>Hello. My name is Simon and I am 44 years old. Two and a half years ago, late in the summer of 2017, I was getting headaches. I was working hard and was feeling tired so initially I put the headaches down to just being busy with work, maybe even rundown. But the headaches continued, in regularity and also in intensity. I booked an appointment to see my doctor and went along.</p>

<p>In October 2017 and November 2017 I had tests, mostly on blood but also on a number of other physical factors. The results that came back werenâ€™t good.</p>

<ol>
  <li>My cholesterol was high.</li>
  <li>My blood sugar â€” at 50 mmol/mol â€” was also high, borderline diabetes territory.</li>
  <li>At just over 15 stone (95 kilograms) I was <em>obese</em>.</li>
  <li>My blood pressure wasnâ€™t great, but it wasnâ€™t terrible either. But, as I was told, if this was a little higher because of the other results Iâ€™d be in big trouble.</li>
</ol>

<p>My doctor went through how I lived my life. I didnâ€™t smoke. I drank alcohol. But Iâ€™d also spent the last six-or-so months cutting down on sugary and fatty foods. (Which is difficult in working environments where biscuits and CAKE are regularly shared.)</p>

<p>My job wavered between days being mainly sat at my desk and days when I was flitting between meetings or workshops. Iâ€™d already â€” because there was the option to thanks to a mindful workplace â€” had been using a standing desk to try to balance the sitting days. I was also already doing physio work â€” to help my left leg after a bad ankle break the year before â€” so I could get running properly again.</p>

<p>My Apple Watch had also been doing a decent job of nudging me to be active to a certain level every day.</p>

<p>But there was work that could be done.</p>

<p>My doctor decided to put me on statins to work on my cholesterol and see how that went. He also advised I was doing some good stuff already, but I need to push things on a little more. Things I could do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lose some weight.</li>
  <li>Manage my diet more. (Which is linked to the above.)</li>
  <li>Cut my alcohol intake a bit.</li>
  <li>Keep an eye on my blood pressure.</li>
  <li>Up my exercise some to do at last 30 minutes of â€œhigher levelâ€ exercise every week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Through 2018 I had to play a longer game, but make sure I went in to see the doctor again for a check up. I kept at the five points, trying to slide in â€œwalking lunch breaksâ€, lowering how much alcohol I drank, being more mindful of what I ate and the amount I ate, and working on my ankle and legs (and making a start on running again, slowly and shortly). I got a Withings blood pressure monitor to do regular checks at home.</p>

<p>I went for my first check up in June 2018 and rang up for my tests results. I was told over the phone I didnâ€™t need to come in. <em>Everything is fine</em> I told myself. I kept at it. My walking and running became easier as my leg and ankle got back to â€œnormalâ€.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year I gave up alcohol and with my legs feeling steady I planned to run about 360 kilometres during 2019. I also added another pledge to try and get eight hours of sleep every night. I felt like I was making progress.</p>

<p>By the middle of 2019 I hadnâ€™t felt fitter for years and I went for my check up. I remember it too well. Sitting down the nurse asked me â€œSo, weâ€™re seeing how your diabetes is getting on, eh.â€ â€œI thought it was more the cholesterol,â€ I replied. The nurse looking at the screen told me â€œwell, 55 is diabetes territory.â€ <em>55</em>? She showed me the screen. The test from the previous summer wasnâ€™t fine: It had shown my blood sugar had got worse. When I phoned for their outcome of my tests the whole results werenâ€™t on screen. The one that mattered the most was off screen, the one indicating â€” as I was seeing on screen now â€” I needed to come in wasnâ€™t seen. For 12 months Iâ€™d been just living, doing all this stuff. Ah well, eh, itâ€™s done. I was here for more tests. Letâ€™s see where we are at.</p>

<p>The tests came back with 44, a downwards trend from the 55 Iâ€™d alarmingly discovered days before. Phew. And my cholesterol was well down. My blood pressure was OK. My weight was down to 13 stone (82.5 kilograms). Just keep doing what youâ€™re doing I was told. It was working.</p>

<p>So weâ€™re now about 8 months on. I had some tests in early February which came back with 49. 55 to 44 to 49. Disappointing. I thought I had this. When I saw the doctor last week he was pretty clear. â€œYouâ€™ve done everything you can. You are in really good shape for someone your age. Itâ€™s time to see how else we can help you.â€ He marked clearly onto my medical record â€” like changing my relationship status on Facebook â€” I have diabetes. â€œSomeone should have done that a long time ago,â€ he said. He explained letâ€™s get some starter tests done and then get me onto a drug and see if that helps. â€œIt might just be for six months, it might be longer. But letâ€™s see how we can help you.â€</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to see the diabetes nurse. I gave three vials of blood and peed into a tube. On Friday Iâ€™ll get a call. â€œWeâ€™ll chat then,â€ said the nurse. Weâ€™ll chat then.</p>
