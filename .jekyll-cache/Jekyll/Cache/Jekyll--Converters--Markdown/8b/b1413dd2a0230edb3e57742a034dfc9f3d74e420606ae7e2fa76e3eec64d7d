  <p>“I hate it. Especially as I have an iPhone. Look. It’s not like it is on <em>your [Nexus 5’s] bigger screen</em>. I have to pinch to zoom <em>and</em> put the phone that bit closer to my face - <em>and</em> squint. It’s horrible. I don’t want to keep going but I have to - I need to find something out. You know when the need is so great, you have to do it <em>now</em>? Yeah, I could have gone and got my laptop to go on the website. But how absurd does that sound? This is 2014.”</p>
