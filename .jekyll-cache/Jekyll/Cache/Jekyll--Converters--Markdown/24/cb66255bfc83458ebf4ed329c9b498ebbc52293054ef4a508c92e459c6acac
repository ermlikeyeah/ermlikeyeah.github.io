I"´<p><em>This weeknote doesnâ€™t carry much about the work I am doing. I was finding my weeknotes about work probably worked better as their own standalone blog posts. If I write any work related blog posts I will link out to them from my weeknotes.</em></p>

<p>Half term so the kids were away, while I kept working. I need to stop doing that.</p>

<p>There is probably a direct correlation between the kidsâ€™ absence and having a bit more evening time than usual, so a trip to the cinema (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502397/">Bad Boys For Life</a>, which was a guilty pleasure, and feel free to judge for I am cool with this decision), some episodes of my rewatch of The Americans (always overlooked but such super TV), and Picard, which is good fun. I finished reading I mean <em>listening</em> to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50792074-the-rise-of-the-ultra-runners">Rise of the Ultra Runners</a>. I need to tie up another read before I start anything new.</p>

<p>The quietness of the house has meant Iâ€™ve had a lot of time this week to <em>think</em>, and some of that led to a couple of small DIY jobs around the house. I always find this is where quiet time to think leads: Fixing something.</p>

<p>Some other thinking came after decisions for two permanent roles Iâ€™d gone for. My contract on NHS Jobs finishes in mid-May so I am looking at what could be next. This means getting on with talking to people and looking around now. One of the roles I missed out on after interviews. I got some lovely honest feedback (which I always try to give when Iâ€™ve interviewed people so nice to get some at the other end of the process). I never set myself up thinking <em>You will get this role</em> but it felt like a good mix, especially as it was something I really cared about butâ€¦ Disappointing but when youâ€™re going for a role youâ€™ve gotta expect failure. Anything else is a bonus. The other role I was offered and again something I am really into. We had some chats, and some right proper chats at that. Sometimes it just doesnâ€™t feel the right fit. I always feel slightly bad after the people youâ€™re talking to have been super open about the state of things, but if I am giving up <em>doing my own thing</em>  it needs to <em>feel right</em>. (I am maybe super attuned to this after <a href="https://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/digital/featured/2014/03/simon-wilson-become-consultant-after-unexpected-departure-home">my time at Home</a>, but hey.) Lovely people. I hope they find the right person for them.</p>

<p>I am trying to run 2000km in 2020. To do this I need to try to run around 40km a week, roughly 170km every month. At the start of the week we were at the midpoint of the month. Iâ€™d done 46km. That is way less than half of 170km. I was ill for the first week of February (and getting going again after illness took a little effort) so my average weekly running needed nudging up <em>a touch</em>. I thought for this week Iâ€™d try to run 60km over the seven days. That would be a tough ask, but doable. If I fell a bit short Iâ€™d be cool, but at least try to push as much over 40km as I could. Itâ€™s just ahead of the weekend: I ran 47.4km, which isnâ€™t disastrous, a decent return, and a couple of rest days in there too. Looking ahead to the weekend I want to get 20km run and hopefully thatâ€™ll put me on course for 150km for the month. 20km short of 170km can be made up with a little bit more effort next month.</p>

<p>You can now get a place for <a href="http://ermlikeyeah.com/leedsgovdesign">Leeds Gov Design meet number 14</a>, which is on Wednesday 8 April, at Merrion House.</p>

<p>I published a post thatâ€™s been lurking in my drafts for a short while, on maps. You can <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/maps">read it here</a>.</p>

<p>I believe in giving back. <a href="https://www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/2020/">Camp Digital</a> is a great little conference and this year I again want to help someone from an underrepresented group attend. I put a shout out on Twitter. Shaun from Sigma said theyâ€™d offer another place too. Iâ€™ll be picking two names next Friday. If youâ€™re interested, <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficeOfWilson/status/1230561336020439041">hereâ€™s the tweet</a>. (That tweet might not be there if you are reading this a month down the line: My tweets are deleted after four weeks.)</p>

<p>Also Iâ€™ve the time and space to mentor someone else. Again I put <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficeOfWilson/status/1230477810235531265">a shout out on Twitter</a>. If youâ€™re interested let me know.</p>

<p>I have recently been asked about moving from a non-tech role into a tech role. I thought it would be interesting what some of my contacts thought, so <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/siwilson_situation-a-person-who-used-be-in-a-non-tech-activity-6636267908496535552-6ISd">I shared on LinkedIn</a>. Some interesting responses in there if you are in or considering being in a similar position.</p>

<p>I switched my public Twitter handle from <a href="https://twitter.com/ermlikeyeah">ermlikeyeah</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficeOfWilson">OfficeOfWilson</a>. Itâ€™s just slightly easier to tell people to be honest.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading this <a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/3-9-february-2020/barnett-freedman-restrospective/">Barnett Freedman</a> piece on the Design Week website.</p>
