<p>I am back at work after a couple of great days back helping with Leeds GovJam. (Check <a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsGovJam/">Leeds GovJam on Twitter</a>.)</p>

<p>On the opening night <a href="https://twitter.com/LeedsGovJam/status/864540348433002497">I raised the most pertinent question for me</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the problem you are solving?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Know, don’t assume.</p>

<p>The teams embraced this and were out doing user research early on in the jam. Great to see people wanting to understand needs, rather than relying on their assumptions.</p>

<p>(All the slides from my opening night lightning talk <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VFxX1FqF2SWNOZb6nLwTDhEehuG1UtYfPG5qEvlxaew/edit?usp=sharing">are here</a> – you’re more than welcome to have them.)</p>

<p>To help the teams focus on the last day I pulled together a quick and purposefully lean slide deck, to <a href="https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery/status/865148200117829632">project onto the wall</a> throughout the morning.</p>

<p>The slides might be a handy reminder for anyone in the early days of discovering the usefulness of their service so I am documenting them here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>By the end of the jam:</strong> Can you answer yes to all of these questions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why.</strong> Know the problem you are trying to solve – based on knowledge not assumptions. What difference will your service bring, what is the impact?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Who.</strong> Who is your service for? You’ve worked from personas to keep you focused.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tested with real people.</strong> Did you test the prototype of your service with people from outside the building?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Iterated to make it better.</strong> Have you made changes to your service based on feedback from potential users to better meet their needs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The unit of delivery is the team.</strong> Your team should work as a collective looking to meet user needs – not driven by individuals, egos, or agendas. Did you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Show the thing, use your thing.</strong> Demonstrate your service. By the end the prototype of your service shouldn’t need an introduction. Does it tell its own story?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep it real, yo.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can get the raw slides over <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oqFvnBJBcE6ec0xRLi3QCQp3TdWgDhbT0UoVCBaq0YA/edit?usp=sharing">on Google Drive</a>.</p>
