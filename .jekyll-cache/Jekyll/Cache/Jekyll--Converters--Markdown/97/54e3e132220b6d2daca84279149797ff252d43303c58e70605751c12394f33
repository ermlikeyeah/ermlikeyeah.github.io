I"S<p>I’ve written before about <a href="/look-sideways-more/">looking sideways</a>, getting out of your bubble to see how others do things. There’s a flip side to that.</p>

<p>Over the past few years* I have always had time to help educate and have conversations about design and digital, from sessions — talks, lectures, and classes — at universities, drop-ins sessions at places like the DWP Digital Academy, to regularly being a mentor at <a href="//bradford-coderdojo.github.io/">Bradford CoderDojo</a>. I prefer these opportunities to “public speaking gigs”. (I’ve only accepted one public speaking engagement in the most recent years, <a href="//www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/archive/2017/simon-wilson/">at the excellent Camp Digital conference</a>.)</p>

<p>Usually these opportunities to share and teach have come as a friendly request through my networks. It’s some stuff — but I don’t think it’s enough. I’d like to do more.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about and share even more the work I do and have done, with the teams I’ve been a part of, and how we have done that work. I also want to have more conversations about what “design” is and can be.</p>

<p>If you’re in education — whether you’re a course leader, teacher, or student — and you’re interested in me coming into where you are or would like to come to where I work, let’s have a chat. My details are the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. I would love to help you.</p>

<p>And if you’re reading this and considering making a similar offer, do it.</p>

<p>*Just worked that out. Since about 2004.</p>
