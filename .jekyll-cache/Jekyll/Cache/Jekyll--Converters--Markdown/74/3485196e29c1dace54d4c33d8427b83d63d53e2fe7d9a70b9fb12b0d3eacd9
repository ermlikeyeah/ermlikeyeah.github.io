I"<p>Hi.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been seeing how some of you use asterisks. In emails. In your tweets. In your Skype messages. Sometimes in your SMS texts.</p>

<p>Y‚Äôknow asterisks, yeah?</p>

<p>This: *. And another one: *. An asterisk and another asterisk. Together ‚Äì ** ‚Äì asterisks.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I‚Äôve been seeing how some of you have been using these.</p>

<p>When I say ‚Äúsome of you‚Äù, I mean a lot of you.</p>

<p>You do this sort of thing:</p>

<p>*points upwards*</p>

<p>*whistles*</p>

<p>*hides under the sofa*</p>

<p>Asterisks highlight emphasis, boldness. They do not highlight action.</p>

<p>Which is what many of you are doing. You are using asterisks to show you are supposedly doing something.</p>

<p>Except to me. I read that are you highlighting those words in, say, Word, and then hitting the <strong>bold</strong> button.</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs wrong. So very, very wrong.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of correct asterisk usage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That gal, she can *really* play the guitar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here‚Äôs another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man of the *90‚Äôs*.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh my God! That shit was *dope*!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of those bits between asterisks? *Emphasised*.</p>

<p>If you want to tell people you <em>point upwards</em> or <em>whistle</em> or <em>hide under the sofa</em>, use square brackets round the action. A [ and a ]. Not a * and a *.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>[points upwards]</p>

<p>[whistles]</p>

<p>[hides under the sofa]</p>

<p>Better. Much, much better.</p>

<p>So, please stick to the proper usage of your asterisks and square brackets. Cut out this asterisk abuse.</p>

<p>If you do I might‚Ä¶ Well, I might do a little jump for joy.</p>

<p>[does finger guns]</p>

<p>Cheers,
Si.</p>
