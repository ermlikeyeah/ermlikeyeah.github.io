I"Œ<p>Having said a short while back that <a href="/leeds-cross-gov-meet-number-2-done/">Leeds cross gov design meet number 2</a> would be the last I could sort, I have some time to sort number 3. It is nice to be able to keep them going.</p>

<p>I am currently looking at the week commencing 2 July. I have set up a <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/6yfczgr6w86afbhs">Doodle poll</a> to help us choose the best time and day. The poll closes in a week, on Friday 9 June.</p>

<p>I have also set up a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leeds-gov-design">Google Group</a> as well to help cross gov design people keep in touch â€“Â and also announce planning and when the meets are. Feel free to join.</p>

<p>Feel free to share these with anyone you know who work on gov or public services in and around Leeds.</p>

<p>As usual, any questions or thoughts, <a href="/contact">give me a shout</a>.</p>
