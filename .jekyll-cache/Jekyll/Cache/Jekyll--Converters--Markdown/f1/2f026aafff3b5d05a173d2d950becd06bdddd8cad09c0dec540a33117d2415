I"°<p>In New York the other day I spotted a sign for wheelchair access to a school.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/new-york-wheelchair-access-sign.jpg" alt="New wheelchair symbol" /></p>

<p>I love it showing people in wheelchairs <em>doing something</em> from the icon, even if it only seems to represent physical movement. I appreciate that not everyone in a wheelchair has as much physical control. Compare to the more established, more static <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Symbol_of_Access">International Symbol of Access</a>. People in wheelchairs can do versus a sense of being immobile.</p>

<p>Two interesting things came out of posting this picture on Twitter:</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/PontoonDock">Mark Morton</a> made me aware he ‚Äúgot management to use this sign when we repainted the disabled parking spaces at work‚Äù. Mark also pointed me in the direction of <a href="http://accessibleicon.org">The Accessible Icon Project</a>, with some background on the symbol and also the chance to <a href="http://accessibleicon.org/#buy">buy stickers and stencils of the icon</a>. The revised symbol was born out of hacking existing signs with stickers. Well worth a read.</p>

    <p>A little later <a href="https://twitter.com/arielmai">Ariel Kennan</a> gave me a heads up to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/07/29/the-handicap-symbol-gets-an-update-at-least-in-new-york-state/?utm_term=.25089db3a3bb">an article</a> with the background to this symbol being used in New York (where I saw it). Basically using this symbol is now the law in New York state.</p>

<p>All interesting stuff.</p>
