I"ı<p><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org">99% Invisible</a> is a consistently brilliant podcast. The recent episode <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pagodas-dragon-gates/">Pagodas and Dragon Gates</a> is particularly recommended, a look at the history and relationship between Chinese immigrants and San Francisco, focused around the cityâ€™s Chinatown.</p>

<p>Following on from the Great Fire, the city looked at how it could make â€œthe perfect cityâ€, and how this led to an unprecedented victory for the cityâ€™s Chinese people and the pursuit of â€œattractive foreignnessâ€, â€œwrong in all the right waysâ€ for the white middle class Americans. Architectural revenge. Itâ€™s fascinating stuff.</p>

<p>Without wanting to spoil the final stretch of the episode, thereâ€™s a poignant reminder of <em>why</em> Chinatown exists even today, especially given Chinatown as a popular tourist destination and San Franciscoâ€™s rep as the city an expensive city to live in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real people live thereâ€¦ Itâ€™s for poor people. Itâ€™s a portal of entry.</p>
