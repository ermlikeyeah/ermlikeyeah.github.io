I"—<p>This morning I was made aware, as I tend to be whenever I go on the Twitters these days, <a href="https://twitter.com/psd/status/434615703916662784">of an event</a> that caught me eye: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/flood-hack-appeal-tickets-8102754557">Flood Hack</a>, which is happening this weekend. The eventâ€™s tweets that caught my eye were from the folk Iâ€™d associated with the Government Digital Service (GDS). (I am not sure if the event if â€˜officially endorsedâ€™, so I wonâ€™t presume it is.)</p>

<p>With David Cameronâ€™s â€œmoney is no objectâ€ comment around the flood support (which Flood Hack is supporting, in its own way), this got me thinking.</p>

<p>The recent decision to ask NHS patients to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Pages/care-data.aspx">opt out of having their information/data passed on to third parties</a> has drawn diatribe for many things, including the room it allows for inconsistencies in canavasing patientsâ€™ option on the matter. A patientâ€™s doctorsâ€™ office  is the one to communicate this matter (not the NHS itself), that if you donâ€™t want your data shared tell <em>them</em> (â€œobjectâ€ as the official language puts it) and theyâ€™ll sort it. As a design of service itâ€™s a bitâ€¦ flimsy, even pass-the-buck, and is open to a lack of consistency and unpredictability.</p>

<p>And yet itâ€™s something that, even in draft form, someone would/should have picked up on.</p>

<p>â€œSo, weâ€™re going to float the responsibility down and ask all the GPs in this country to communicate to their patients something we, as a governing body, are dictating?â€</p>

<p>With us - this Britain! - having what is now an internationally award winning and highly respected GDS, that is seen as <em>responsive</em> and <em>agile</em>, would it have not hurt someone - in the NHS, in the government - to have bent GDSâ€™s ear a little, even if it was to hack together something that could funnel patientsâ€™ responses?</p>

<p>While my mental dots might be a little spread out, itâ€™s still a thought that occupies my mind. There must have been a simpler way, where someone could have joined the dots.</p>
