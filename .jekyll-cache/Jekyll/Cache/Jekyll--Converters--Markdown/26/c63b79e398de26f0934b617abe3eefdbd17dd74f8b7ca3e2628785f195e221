I"W<p>There’s still mumblings about Ben Affleck being cast as Batman in whatever the sequel to <em>Man of Steel</em> is called.</p>

<p>If the noise generated by fanboys was acknowledged then Affleck would be out. Someone else would be in. Who? God knows. There’s too many alternatives.</p>

<p>But the beauty of Affleck being cast? Hardly anyone called it. Warners just announced it, and a helluva lotta folk went <em>HUH?!</em>.</p>

<p>That it is a leftfield casting choice makes it all the more fascinating. It’s a move that crowd-sourcing may never have come up with. And to me, it’s a move that actually made me think “I can sort of see that. And I <em>want</em> to see that. It’ll be interesting.”</p>

<p>There’s a lot to be said for giving people the chance to see something they would never have imagined. Long live disruption.</p>
