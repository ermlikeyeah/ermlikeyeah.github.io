<p>I’ve done that thing – when the days start to get shorter and the days get colder, at that point of the year where one is weary and needs a bit of a shot in the arm to keep going until the inevitable enforced end of year break – I seek solace in lunchtimes to talk about worky stuff with some friends more than ever. Warm the cockles, as it were.</p>
