I"Ø<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>

<p>At the end of every week I take a little time to do a brain dump for myself in Evernote. I believe in working in the open and try to share some/most/all of the work bit of my brain dump as blog posts. (Coincidentally ‚Äúmake things open‚Äù is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better">a government design principle</a>.) It is not always that straightforward.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January I moved to a new service at DWP Digital, working as a service designer. I am trying to share what I can. Some of these notes might be vague because I am being mindful of‚Ä¶ stuff. Apologies in advance if that stands out. I‚Äôd rather share some things than no things. :-)</p>

<p>If you are interested in doing your own week notes there is an excellent post by <a href="https://samvillis.com/2018/10/12/weeknote-styles/">Sam Villis</a> to help you.</p>
