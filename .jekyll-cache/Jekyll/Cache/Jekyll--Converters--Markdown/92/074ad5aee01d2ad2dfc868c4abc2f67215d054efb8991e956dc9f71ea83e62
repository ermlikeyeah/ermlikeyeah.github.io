I"Ï<p>Once <a href="//transformation.blog.nhs.uk/talking-at-ehi-live-2016">my first post for the NHS.UK Transformation blog was up</a> (a quick recap of the EHI Live session I was on) it was full into a week of pretty much full time, full on designing this week. I am trying this sprint to get us from next to nothing tangible (other than a hypothesis) to some sort of working in-browser prototype. The last day of the sprint is this coming Monday. No pressure.</p>
