I"<p>This morning I was made aware, as I tend to be whenever I go on the Twitters these days, <a href="https://twitter.com/psd/status/434615703916662784">of an event</a> that caught me eye: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/flood-hack-appeal-tickets-8102754557">Flood Hack</a>, which is happening this weekend. The event’s tweets that caught my eye were from the folk I’d associated with the Government Digital Service (GDS). (I am not sure if the event if ‘officially endorsed’, so I won’t presume it is.)</p>
