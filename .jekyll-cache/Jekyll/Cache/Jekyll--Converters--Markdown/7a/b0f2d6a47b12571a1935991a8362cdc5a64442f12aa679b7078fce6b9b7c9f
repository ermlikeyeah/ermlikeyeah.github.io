I"o<p>A great post by <a href="https://twitter.com/leisa">Leisa Reichelt</a> – the recently departed head of user reasearch at GDS – for the weekend (and beyond once you’ve read it) on <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/stop-your-team-using-technical-terms-and-jargon/">Stop your team using technical terms and jargon</a>. A great post and one that will strike a chord with a lot of people.</p>

<p>As a little footnote, to Leisa’s piece if you disband jargon within your organisation and move towards plain language, could there be far less need – maybe even no need – to “translate” your organisation’s language into your user’s, your audience’s own language?</p>

<p>Working in the public sector at the moment, which seems to pride itself on the language it “owns” and uses, it’s certainly something that hangs at the back of my mind every day.</p>
