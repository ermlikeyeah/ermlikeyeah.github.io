<p>Currently I am contracting as a service designer for <a href="//difrent.co.uk">Difrent</a> on the NHS Jobs project at <a href="//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk">NHS BSA</a>, until May 2020. I am <a href="/work-note-2020-january/">figuring out what I will be doing after that date</a>.</p>

<p>I write <a href="/tags/#weeknotes">week notes</a> which sometimes mention work and a more specific <a href="/tags/#work%20notes">monthly work note</a>.</p>

<p>I coordinate the <a href="/leedsgovdesign/">Leeds gov design meets</a>, a regular meet-up for people in and around Leeds who are designing and making public services. I am organising the next <a href="/leedsgovdesign">Leeds Gov Design</a> meet for early April 2020.</p>

<p>I have two upcoming speaking engagements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A private one, on my running adventures in 2019</li>
  <li>A public one, on accessible products and services, at the next Product People North in May 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>I currently have no spare time to take on any further “full time” mentoring. Sorry. Three people is as many as I can help at the mo. If you just need an hour to chat with someone about work I could squeeze something in though.</p>

<p>If you are interested in how I can help you or your organisation please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>
