I"<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jukesie">Matt Jukes</a> recently wrote a brilliant, really brilliant <a href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/product-is-a-team-sport-c50d234745e#.3gaxom9p0">piece on culture and hiring</a> to supplement his <a href="http://designswansea.org.uk">Design Swansea</a> talk. Put the time aside and read it.</p>

<p>Matt also asked me if I could answer some questions for him, for a series called <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em>. Easy peasy, I thought. Dipping in and out over two weeks I finally finished it. Matt’s just published it. I won’t be republishing it here any time soon, so <a href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/what-is-it-you-actually-do-simon-wilson-fe15a732b7ad#.kabylpgqz">head on over and read it on Medium</a>.</p>
