I"÷<p>Following on from <a href="http://www.ermlikeyeah.com/forefront-leeds-november-2014-reeves-rosser/">my talk at Forefront in Leeds back in November</a>, I found a video on YouTube of an interesting chat between Jon Favreau and Martin Scorsese on Martyâ€™s preference of story over plot, or â€œrather because of character and a very different approach to storyâ€.</p>

<p>An interesting partner to my talk, the key moment is when Marty says â€œI know the plot and itâ€™s not interesting any moreâ€.</p>

<p>Which in turns reminds me of William Goldman: â€œGive the audience what they want, but not in the way they expect.â€</p>
