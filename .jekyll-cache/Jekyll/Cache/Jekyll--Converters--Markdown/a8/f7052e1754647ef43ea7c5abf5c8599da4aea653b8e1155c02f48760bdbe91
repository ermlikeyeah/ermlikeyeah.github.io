I"ë<p>Thereâ€™s been a really great Saul Bass pitch doing the rounds on the digital socials at the mo. (Even though it was posted in late 2011.)</p>

<p>A reminder that Bass didnâ€™t just do cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqM3McG4-LE">title sequences</a> for Alfred Hitchcock and <a href="http://www.saulbassposterarchive.com/gallery/film-posters/">quad posters</a>. And a reminder even people as revered as Bass had to pitch.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s well worth half an hour of your time. Donâ€™t worry. The image above isnâ€™t a late spoiler â€“ itâ€™s early on. Thereâ€™s plenty more great moments in the film.</p>
