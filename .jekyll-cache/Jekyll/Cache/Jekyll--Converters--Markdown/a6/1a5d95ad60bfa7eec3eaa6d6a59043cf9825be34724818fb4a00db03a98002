I"£<p>A few weeks back I <a href="/public-design-WY">wrote about trying out Public Design WY</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking to organise a get-together in West Yorkshire about design and designing for the public.</p>

<p>Originally the plan was to hold it on Wednesday 29 March. Due to a few things (work, holidays, Article 50, general burying heads under pillows) we put it off.</p>

<p>We now have a date, a time, and a space.</p>

<p>Where: <a href="http://futurelabs.org.uk">Futurelabs in Leeds</a>.</p>

<p>When: Thursday 4 May, from 6pm until no later than 8pm. We will be going for a ‚Äúdebrief‚Äù in a pub afterwards.</p>

<p>What will be there: A series of front-of-room led sessions, from talks to workshops.</p>

<p>Who is it for: Anyone who is interested in design for the public. That is ‚Äúdesign‚Äù as a wide view. And we are looking at designing for the public, again as a wide view ‚Äì wider than just in gov ‚Äì to reflect the breadth of public design work in the region.</p>

<p>Public Design WY is free to attend. You just need to tell us you want to come. You can do that over at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Public-Design-WY/events/239151881/">the session‚Äôs page on Meetup</a>. Just indicate you want to come. Spaces are limited. We will also publish any further updates there.</p>

<p>The agenda will be announced in very soon, but just getting interesting and interested people along to listen, share, and possibly collaborate is half the fun.</p>

<p>If you have something you want to share, talk about, or run as a 20 minutes-ish session <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>. Don‚Äôt be scared! We‚Äôre all friends.</p>

<p>So, please come! And hopefully see you there!</p>
