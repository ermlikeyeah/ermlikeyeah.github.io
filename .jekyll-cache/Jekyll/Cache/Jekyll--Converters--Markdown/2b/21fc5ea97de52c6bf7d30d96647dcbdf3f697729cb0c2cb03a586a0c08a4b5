I"z<p>A few years ago, at the place I worked at back then, there were several doors into the office. I usually went through the “front door”, the door we expected visitors to use.</p>

<p>As I went in, the front door had a handle on the side facing me. More often than not I grabbed the handle and pulled.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>The door refused to open.</p>

<p>I pulled again.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>The door refused to open — because the door needed to be pushed.</p>

<p>Despite regularly using the door, I did this, I still did this, <em>the door</em> did this.</p>

<p>I saw the handle, I pulled it.</p>

<p>The door didn’t open towards me.</p>

<p>I’d remember I needed to push the door.</p>

<p>(Maybe I kept doing it in the hope one day I’d pull and it would open towards me.)</p>

<p>I wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>I’d be sat at my desk.</p>

<p>THUNK. THUNK.</p>

<p>I’d glance up. It’s one of my colleagues, staring at the handle, like they were stuck in an airlock.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>THUNK THUNK.</p>

<p>A look up. It’s one of our clients staring into the studio like we’d invited them over just to lock them out.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>I raised could we remove the handle, put a flat hand pad in its place to give some visible indication to the door user they should push — not grab the handle and pull.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>No, was the answer. The landlord wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p>I put a sign up on the door saying “PUSH THIS DOOR, DON’T PULL THE HANDLE.”</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>The sign lasted a day. It gave the wrong impression.</p>

<p>Can’t we get the handle replaced?</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>No was the answer. The landlord wouldn’t allow it.</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>Let’s put a sign up? No…</p>

<p>THUNK.</p>

<p>And there we exited the loop.</p>

<p>And the THUNKs continued.</p>

<p>THUNK. THUNK. THUNK.</p>

<p>Looking back it wasn’t necessarily the THUNK, the sound, that was annoying. It was what the THUNK represented. Here was our front door - the front door to our own office - THUNKing away because we couldn’t change the handle or put a sign up - or change people’s preconception of what that door handle means to them. (Bloody <em>people</em> and <em>their expectancy</em> of behaviour!) We sold ourselves as a business that understood people, and here’s our front door tripping that up before you’d even come through the front door.</p>

<p>“At least you’ve a reminder of what bad design is at the start of your day,” quipped a colleague. Everything’s upwards from there, hey!</p>

<p>I’d rather not notice good design - things that work with minimum or no intrusion to my behaviour - than be abruptly aware of bad design. If something is going to challenge the norm, I want to be delighted, not frustrated, impeded, pissed off even. Especially at how I enter something, especially at the start of something.</p>

<p>You?</p>
