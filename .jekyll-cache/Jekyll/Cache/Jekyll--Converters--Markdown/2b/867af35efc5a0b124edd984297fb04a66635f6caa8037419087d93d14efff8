I"7<p>In late November I wrote about <a href="/look-sideways-more/">looking sideways more</a>. I suggested it’s a thing that you should look into doing a bit more – because I find it the kind of thing that’s useful.</p>

<p>As 2017 kicks off I find myself with a chance to do a bit more of that: I’ve gotta take some days off away from <a href="//transformation.blog.nhs.uk">NHS Beta</a> between now and the end of March.</p>

<p>There’s half term in the middle of February, so some family time there. But, other than that? Well, my wife has a job that keeps her busy during the week. And my kids are old enough they have their own lives. And if those guys aren’t free? That leaves a few other days left I need to take.</p>

<p>I could just fill the time with… stuff. But I’ve spent enough time over the years just filling time. I hate it.</p>

<p>I could group all that time together and do a stretch freelancing somewhere. Here’s the flip side: I love the work I do these days and the places I do it.</p>

<p>So, here’s an offer: I will gladly use some of those days off to nip in and spend time with at other places working on things that matter – and maybe me being there will be a look sideways for you too.</p>

<p>I’m up for owt, whether it’s help with the work you’re doing, general cheerleading about design, or showing up to give you a morale boost. It’s 9.40pm as I end tapping this. An hour-and-a-half ago I made this offer on Twitter and already have a couple of days planned in. If you’re interested just <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a>.</p>
