<p>Target to run in 2019: 1092 kilometres</p>

<p>Total distance ran so far in 2019: 942 kilometres</p>

<p>Recorded in <a href="https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0cWhQqgPDF2FKXSnUdB79lWVw#2019_running">my little tracking spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="goals-for-july-2019">Goal(s) for July 2019</h3>

<p>Run 100 kilometres. (I ran 70.6 kilometres, which was less than the desired 100 kilometres, but more on that in the words.)</p>

<p>Enjoy it still. (I am, possibly the most in July than I did any time before.)</p>

<p>Now up to 1013 kilometres ran this year. 1092 kilometres is the goal for 2019 so just 79 kilometres to go. ğŸ™ŒğŸ¼</p>

<h3 id="the-words">The words</h3>

<p>I knew coming into this month itâ€™d be a bit different. <a href="https://www.ermlikeyeah.com/run-notes-2019-july/">Last monthâ€™s 200 kilometres</a> left me feeling a bit wiped out at the start. And a holiday was around the corner. So I had a few days off from running. See out a couple of days of work, spend a couple of days travelling, andâ€¦</p>

<p>Land in New York and have a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2592761495">good pound in Manhattan up and back the East River</a>, with the dog.</p>

<p>The next day, onto the Williamsburg Bridge for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2595652168">solid 5km there and back</a>. That was <em>warm</em>.</p>

<p>Runs I discovered and will add to a bucket list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After the Williamsburg Bridge run I did some looking into possible circuits involving a couple of the bridges over the East River. I found [this one].</li>
  <li>Visited <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;q=roosevelt+island&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOyM-ziK_kAhVUPcAKHUaJDR4Q_AUoAXoECBIQAQ">Roosevelt Island</a>: Looks like thereâ€™s a good circuit of the island, of about 5km, maybe? Also, the tube station on the island would be a good start/stop point.</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s a few in Central Park. Brant suggested a couple. I just didnâ€™t have time to fit anything in.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple of days in Manhattan and then it was upstate. Looking for trails and routes was harder than it was in the UK, or at least seemed so. I was finding segments on Strava but they seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, no marked paths or trails on the digital maps. I was having to do some digging where the paths ands trails where.</p>

<p>But the first day upstate I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2601475538">just went out</a> and saw where Iâ€™d go. Working through the trails in Russel Wrightâ€™s estate <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoga">Manitoga</a>, I eventually found myself on some trails in the woods to the east of the estate. And from there it was fun running along, a couple of checks that I was heading north and not heading east, and must have run through at least eight spider webs across their track.</p>

<p>Having avoided hill running I found <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2606839418">a neat 3km there-and-back on a nearby road</a>, which wasnâ€™t fun on the way up but more fun on the way down. Five days later I <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2618531715">had another go</a>.</p>

<p>After coming back down the 9D on my first upstate run, I chanced running along the 9D some more, to get a look at the Hudson River from the shore. I had my first experience of Not All Roads On Google Maps Are Public Roads, as someone came out of their house to tell me â€œI donâ€™t want to interrupt your run butâ€¦ this a private road.â€ I didnâ€™t see any signs, on the way back up I didnâ€™t see any signs. Iâ€™d <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1BrHZIHJgR/">seen the shore</a> by that point so huh. I got back to the 9D and headed down to the nature <em>preserve</em>. What felt like a worry about running the 9D was unfounded: A lot of drivers went past giving me and them a little more room, which I have rarely seen in the UK. One dude even said â€œkeep going!â€ as they went past. (<em>Said</em> not <em>shouted</em>.)</p>

<p>After the first trek into the nearby woods I had ordered some â€œproperâ€ trail running shoes â€“ my first â€“ grabbing some New Balance Gobi v3, and <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2609827104">went out into the woods again</a>, this time heading south once Iâ€™d got out of the Wright estate (which was much easier having done it before) and touching on some of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail">Appalachian Trail</a>, before getting onto a road that eased down the mountain to the 9D.</p>

<p>The time upstate was closed off with another 9D adventure <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2624014172">up towards Garrison train station and round the woods there</a>.</p>

<p>But all really good fun runs out upstate, and that probably wouldnâ€™t have been the case if Iâ€™d not done all the sorting my legs out stuff the last 12 months. There was a point on the first run through the woods upstate (and it didnâ€™t last long because I hit loads of grass that made me slow down butâ€¦) I felt like I was close to hurtling along as Iâ€™d ever be.</p>

<p>Socks: Iâ€™ve been using some alright Nike running socks. Canâ€™t complain. A couple of months ago I invested in some compression socks, some Nike ones and some <a href="https://1000mile.co.uk/product/1000-mile-compression-sock-2/">1000 Miles</a>. While I was in America I branched out a bit more into the world of socks getting some <a href="https://balega-socks.implus.com">Balega</a> (US Yarn, made in South Africa), <a href="running-socks/">Rockhttps://rockay.com/product-category/ay</a>, <a href="https://www.drymaxsports.com">Drymax</a>, and <a href="https://www.lebent.com/en/shop/product/le-sock-run-ultra-light-micro">Le Bent</a>.</p>

<p>Back home and back to work and back on the road. A stopover in Newcastle one day I drove out to Whitley Bay for <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2636347752">a run along the coast</a>. It wasnâ€™t as long as I hoped. Days on the road I feel more tired at the end of the day, probably because I am up at about 5am and running at 7pm isnâ€™t quite what my mind or body wants. But it was a sunny enough, I went past <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Lighthouse">St Maryâ€™s Lighthouse</a>, and on the return leg I dipped down to running along the beach. You know when the tide is going out and thereâ€™s the sea on your left, thereâ€™s all their dry sand on your right, and youâ€™re running along the moist sand that is just firm enough to run along? Thatâ€™s good stuff, that.</p>

<p>Generally finding routes to try is a bit of a trawl. Sometimes I spy routes when I nosey in on other local runnersâ€™ efforts stored on Strava. Google searches usually bring up <a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/my_home/">Map My Run</a> stuff, whose interface is a little bit of a faff, but itâ€™s a resource to dig into.</p>

<p>The effort does pay off though. On bank holiday Monday I was looking to do 10 kilometres but a) pretty much from the doorstep, but b) with some difference. I found <a href="https://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/2658027838">something on Map My Run</a> that seemed to go along the canal and then ping off and then back on. The start/finish points werenâ€™t near our house, but itâ€™s a loop so start/finish points can just move around the loop. The route seemed to come off the canal at Rodley near the Railway Pub and then hop over the River Aire â€“ which sounded fun. We used to live in Rodley, but never went as far up the hill as this route suggested, and havenâ€™t been in the fields and woods up there either.</p>

<p>I transposed the route <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/21335835">to a Strava one</a>, which gave me a chance to check out where I might be turning.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t quite take the route I found, but I did have fun. The trot along the road through the woods reminded me of being in the woods in upstate New York a few weeks before. Christ, thereâ€™s some massive houses up there. And oh thatâ€™s where that road off Harrogate Road leads to.</p>

<p>I am going to try and convert any decent runs into routes on Strava. <a href="https://www.strava.com/routes/21343315">Hereâ€™s the route for the run</a>. Be good if Strava routes allowed you to note tips, like â€œa bit of this is along a track with brambles at this time of yearâ€. Not sure Strava is the best place to store these routes though. What is the â€œWikipedia for running routesâ€? Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Yesterday to close the month I went for a small steady run (3km-ish), a short break (a couple of minutes walking) and then a much faster chunk. No nowt massive, about a minute, about 300 metres, but a small stretch to see how my legs would take an open-up. I finished, was fine, was ambling along the 100 metres to the road, and a runner coming towards me asked me â€œNeed a gel?â€, one in his hand. â€œThank but I am done.â€ Evermore though I find the spirit around running so helpful and generous, which I never expected.</p>

<p>That was a good running month. Quality over quantity.</p>

<h3 id="next-months-goals">Next monthâ€™s goals</h3>

<p>Go for a run five days every week. (Basically: Clock 20 runs in September.)</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been reading a bit the last few months about <em>quality</em> of runs not <em>quantity</em>, thinking about time over distance, and speed in shorter bursts. I am going to try some <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fartlek">fartlek</a> amongst the longer runs, hopefully once a week, but at least twice in September.</p>

<p>If I can do 100 kilometres in September, Iâ€™d be happy.</p>

<p>Keep enjoying it!</p>
