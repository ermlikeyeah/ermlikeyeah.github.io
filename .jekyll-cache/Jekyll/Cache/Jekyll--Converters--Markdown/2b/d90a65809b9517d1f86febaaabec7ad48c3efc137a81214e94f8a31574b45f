<p>TL;DR: We need to look at creating new institutions to take advantage of digital, not build on top of what is there already, not reforming what is there. The impediments are the current structures, process, systems, etc.</p>

<p>Before or after you watch this, worth reminding yourself of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution-a-report-by-martha-lane-fox">Martha Lane Fox’s Directgov 2010 and beyond report</a> again.</p>
