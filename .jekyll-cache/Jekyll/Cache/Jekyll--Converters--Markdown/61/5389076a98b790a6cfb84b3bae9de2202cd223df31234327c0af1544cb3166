I"	<p><a href="/openly-talking-across-government-about-design">Earlier this week I suggested</a> if you <em>read one thing this week</em>, make it <a href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/23/user-research-and-design-in-home-office-digital/">Katy Arnold’s recent piece on designing within Home Office Digital</a>.</p>

<p>If you <em>listen to one thing this week</em>, make it the recent episode of the FiveThirtyEight podcast, <em><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/whats-the-point/">What’s The Point</a></em>.</p>

<p>FiveThirtyEight has ballooned since it was just a vehicle for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver">Nate Silver</a>’s amazing eye-opening data sport and political analysis, and is now a more wider data digging publication. Lots of good stuff on there, including their regular podcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-the-bronx-really-burned/">The recent episode <em>Why the Bronx Burned</em></a> is a fascinating discussion with <a href="http://joe-flood.com/">Joe Flood</a>.</p>

<p>In an engrossing talk that springboards from Flood’s evocative book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Fires-Intentions-City-Determined/dp/1594485062">The Fire</a></em> it’s a fascinating dive into the increasingly-popularised phrase “smart cities” – but by jumping back in time to the mid-1970s, to a time when one of the world’s most famous cities was on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>During the talk Flood discusses assumptions, bias, models, data, and some very painful learning in - in short - allocating resources and creating efficiencies within a city in a rational way, by using data – but so, so wrong.</p>

<p>It’s gripping stuff, a warning that relying on data with poor analysis is, quite literally, playing with fire. And how the data is framed, to blame.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s one thing to say “that politician closed that firehouse.” It’s another to say “science closed that firehouse.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while you listen to it, while the guys on the podcast talk about decisions taken during a time when government finances were squeezed, maybe think about the now.</p>
