I"ß<p>A few weeks back I rattled together a very quick sticker. I put it on Twitter. People seemed to like it. Iâ€™ve now done an asterisked, more â€œfamily friendlyâ€ version.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/i-do-this.jpg" alt="I do this because I am f*cking sick things do't work people expect them to sticker" /></p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve sent that design off to the printers and got quite a few on the way. 5cm square, heavyweight matt, with a spot gloss varnish on the words and border. And I am giving them away.</p>

<p>If you want one (or some) of the sticker, Iâ€™ve set up a Google form to gather your details. Just <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/fne6kDUVOVWsKlmC3">fill in the form</a> and Iâ€™ll do the rest.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re welcome.</p>
