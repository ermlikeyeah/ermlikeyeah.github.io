I"1<p>Sorry about the break since <a href="//medium.com/nhs-beta-leeds-weeknotes/weeknotes-s01e07-f5cbc366f994#.rx4ys29kj">the last weeknotes</a>. Think of this like you’ve had a holiday away from it all, you’ve left the generic digital TV recording box to collect the episodes of something while you’re away and there’s a little bit of catching up to do. Just this is a bit less exciting, a bit more mundane than Corro, ‘enders, Game of Thrones, Westworld, Halt and Catch Fire, or those other ones set in the Yorkshire Dales or Chester or wherever.</p>
