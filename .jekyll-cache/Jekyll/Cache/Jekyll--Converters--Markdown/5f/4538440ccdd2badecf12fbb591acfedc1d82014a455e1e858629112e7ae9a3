I"ò<p>Working from the shed today I had to clear the whiteboard off a bit so I could hang some stuff up.</p>

<p>A few months back I went to <a href="https://www.service-design-network.org/chapters/uk/events/service-design-futures-defining-your-niche-in-our-evolving-industry">Service Design Futures</a> event at UAL, which was excellent.</p>

<p>In the corridor by the hall we were in was a wall highlighting the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-communication/about-lcc/design-school">UAL design school</a> manifesto, and as tear sheets.</p>

<p>The full manifesto:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We believe in design as site of action and agency to radically transform our world.</li>
  <li>We believe in the power of design to critique, confront and challenge inequalities.</li>
  <li>We believe in questioning geopolitical, socio-cultural, and disciplinary boundaries.</li>
  <li>We believe that design operates in an ecology beyond the human centric.</li>
  <li>We believe that learning is continuous, collaborative and creative.</li>
  <li>We believe in the power of making as critical practice and tangible intervention.</li>
  <li>We believe in embracing uncertainty through experimentation and risk-taking.</li>
  <li>We believe in the value of interrogating the past to shape our futures.</li>
</ol>

<p>The manifesto is ‚Äúintended as a work in progress, always in process and open to commentary, conversation and critique.‚Äù</p>

<p>I grabbed me some of those sheets and had them stuck to the shed whiteboard since.</p>

<p>I bloody love that seventh point. From the corridor of UAL to the corridor of uncertainty. Always in that corridor of uncertainty ain‚Äôt we.</p>
