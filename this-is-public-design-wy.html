  Public Design WY is now <a href="/leedsgovdesign">Leeds Gov Design</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Public Design WY was a regular meet-up for anyone who interested in design and designing for the public.
</p>

<p>
  We borrowed a space, organised the sessions for the meet-up, and invited you along.
</p>

<p>
  Sessions were talks, workshops, videos, whatever. We tried to keep it down to earth, small(ish), about being open and sharing in a safe space, among friends! The aim was we hoped you took something away from them.
