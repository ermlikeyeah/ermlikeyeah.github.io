<p>
  A regular meet-up in West Yorkshire for anyone who is interested in design and designing for the public.
</p>

<p>
  We borrow a space, organise the sessions, invite you along. Sessions can be talks, workshops, videos, whatever. It's down to earth, kept small(ish), about being open, and sharing in a safe space. You will be among friends! And we hope you take something away from the meet-up.
