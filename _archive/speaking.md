I am open to do 'speaking' sessions, particularly if it is an opportunity to share the work I have been involved with â€“ and have those ways of working challenged!

I have talked publicly on numerous occasions before, at events like NUX and Forefront, as well as being invited into places to do "behind closed doors" talks.

This year I am scheduled to talk at Camp Digital in Manchester, in May. More information [is here](//www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/2017/).

If you are interested in me doing a talking session, feel free to [drop me a line](/contact).
