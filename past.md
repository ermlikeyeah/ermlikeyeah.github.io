## Work

Since 2014 I have worked as a freelancer. I have mainly contracted on public sector projects, as

* An interaction and service designer at the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](//www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government), [Royal Borough of Greenwich](//www.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/), [NHS BSA](//www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk), [DWP Digital](//dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/) and [HMRC Digital](//hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk), and helped with leading design at [NHS Digital](//digital.nhs.uk) on the NHS Beta programme.
* A product manager on the [national Covid vaccination booking service](//digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/vaccinations/booking-systems/national-booking-service) at what felt like the whole of the English public health sector.

Between 2000 and 2014 I held head of, director, and board positions at the agencies [Home](//www.homeagency.co.uk), [Bloom](//www.bloomagency.co.uk), and [Brahm](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)), responsible for the digital, design, and creative parts of those companies.

I got my first full time job in 1998, starting as a junior web developer on [Sporting Life](//www.sportinglife.com/). I got to play with databases full of sport data and work out how to put all that onto the internet as information. It was the best first job I could have wished for.
