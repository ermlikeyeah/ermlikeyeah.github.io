## Work

Since 2015 I have worked as a freelancer. I have mainly contracted on public sector projects, as an interaction and service designer at [DWP Digital](//dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/) and [HMRC Digital](//hmrcdigital.blog.gov.uk), and helped with leading design at [NHS Digital](//digital.nhs.uk) on the NHS Beta programme.

Between 2000 and 2015 I held head of, director, and board positions at the agencies [Home](//www.homeagency.co.uk), [Bloom](//www.bloomagency.co.uk), and [Brahm](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_(company)), responsible for the digital, design, and creative parts of those companies.

I got my first full time job in 1998, starting as a junior web developer on [Sporting Life](//www.sportinglife.com/). I got to play with databases full of sport data and work out how to put all that onto the internet as information. It was the best first job I could have wished for.

## Non-work

I am proud to have helped co-organise [Leeds Digital Festival](//leedsdigitalfestival.org) between 2010 and 2013 and to have been one of the co-founders of award-winning Grimsby Town fanzine [Cod Almighty](//codalmighty.com/).
